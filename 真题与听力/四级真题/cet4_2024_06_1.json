      "passage_content": "Six people had to move away from their home to another place after a fire broke out in a building on Main Street Saturday, officials said. Firefighters responded to the three-story building shortly after 1 p.m. for a reported structure fire, according to Norwalk Deputy Fire Chief Adam Markowitz.\n\nMarkowitz said crews encountered heavy smoke coming from the second floor when they arrived. A team of about 25 firefighters then spent about 25 minutes extinguishing the flames. Officials described the structure as a mixed-use building that features commercial businesses on the first floor and residential on the second and third floors.\n\nTown records list four apartments in the building. Due to smoke and heat damage, the four apartments were declared uninhabitable, and the six residents had to move to another place, officials said. No injuries were reported in connection with the fire. The Norwalk Fire Marshal is investigating the cause and origin of the fire.\n\nA new study has cast doubt on historic research suggesting that the season or month of someone's birth is associated with an increased risk of certain mental health conditions. The study looks at symptoms of anxiety and depression among more than 70,000 older adults in Europe. A number of past studies have found the link between season of birth and mental health diagnoses.\n\nResearchers have suggested that such links could arise from various things. These include nutrient intake, sun exposure, climate, and disease exposure varying across the course of the year. However, evidence has been mixed. More recent studies have suggested that factors such as social class or economic background have more to do with these diagnoses than month of birth.\n\nOverall, the new study found no significant relationship between participants' month of birth and symptoms of depression or anxiety. There was some variability in some countries. In Poland, depressive symptoms fluctuated a little depending on birth month. In the Czech Republic, the same was true of anxiety symptoms. But on the whole, there was no systematic pattern.\n\nGenetic researchers in China have made a clone of a star police dog. The clone was born in a laboratory in Beijing in December. Tests show that the clone and her mother are almost identical genetically. The mother dog helped solve multiple murders and many other crimes. The clone has already performed better than traditionally bred dogs on several tests.\n\nIf the clone continues to perform as well as expected, it could mean a huge reduction in the training time for police dogs, which usually takes about five years. The ultimate goal of scientists is to produce clones of talented police dogs that can be trained in months instead of years. However, this goal is not yet possible due to the current costs of the technology.\n\nThis is not the first time a clone has been made of a star police dog. In South Korea, six clones began working with the police in 2008.",

      "passage_content": "W: Tom, did you see the article online about the new TV series based on the book The Three Body Problem?\nM: A colleague mentioned the book, but I've been so busy writing my thesis that I haven't been able to read for pleasure in months.\nW: Well, sounds like if you're going to read anything for fun, this is the book. It's written by a Chinese science fiction writer. I can't remember his name, but he's written three books in all, and The Three Body Problem is the first in the series. I don't want to say too much and spoil it for you, but it's definitely got some amazing technological and sociological concepts in it.\nM: It does sound like it would suit my taste, but if they are making a TV series based on it now, I don't know if I should read the book or watch the show first.\nW: I think it's better to read the book first. It's rare for the show or movie to be better than the book. And then, you just end up ruining the book for yourself, if the show isn't very good.\nM: When is the show supposed to start? I'm a bit overwhelmed with the amount of data I still need to collect to finish my thesis. But I still need to relax sometimes.\nW: I can't remember exactly. It's pretty soon, and it's going to be quite long. There are 24 episodes. Well, maybe you could download an electronic copy of the book and try to read it before the show starts.\nM: That's a good idea. And then, maybe we can watch the series together. Thanks for the tip, Alice.\nW: No problem.\n\nW: Hello, good afternoon. I have an inquiry to make. It's about the vegetarian food festival you are holding on the 19th of August at the Newcastle City Hall.\nM: Yes, of course. My name's Philip. How can I help you?\nW: It says on your website that you are still looking for vendors, and I grow organic vegetables on my farm, as well as doing my own home baking. Would I be able to sell both the vegetables and items baked from them at the festival?\nM: That's exactly the type of thing we are looking for. We're getting close to the deadline, however. Do you prefer to fill out an application on the web, or to print it out and fill it in by hand and then post it back to us? Remember that you will have to have all your certificates to hand when you are filling out the forms, as the standards are high and they'll be carefully checked before anyone will be able to sell their produce at the event.\nW: I should be fine with doing it on your website, and I already have all my certificates, as we run a small farm shop too. But can you give me your details anyway?\nM: Sure. Please address it to the Organic Organization, Vendor Applications, 112 Queens Road, Newcastle, Northumbria. The postcode is NU 29 3LJ. Remember that the closing date is next Tuesday, the 28th of June.\nW: That's absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for your help. Goodbye.",

      "passage_content": "Supporters call it \"wild camping\"; opponents call it \"illegal camping\". What both sides accept is that there has been a boom in the past few months, with increasing numbers of visitors pitching their tents on any bit of land they fancy in the UK. In part, this reflects the fact that official campsites have been wholly or partially closed, or are overflowing in a summer when fewer people are going abroad. It is also cheap, at a time when many are worried about what the economic future holds. But it may also be an expression of a desire for going outdoors—a response to the months of lockdown.\n\nMost of the coverage of the boom in wild camping has been negative. Camping in public parks has now been banned for August and the early part of September because campers dump litter, human waste, and even their tents on the grassland. Similar action has been taken even in Scotland, where camping is usually permitted on most of its open land.\n\nClearly there have to be rules. It would make sense that wild campers need to ask for permission to camp from landowners, especially outside Scotland, where the law is far more restrictive. It would be common sense for people to use small tents and leave no trace of their visit. They have been attracted by a patch of land this close to wilderness, and it is their responsibility to keep it that way.\n\nImagine boating down the Amazon River, minding your own business—calmly keeping an eye out for alarmingly large snakes—and a curious pink dolphin appears to swim alongside. While this may seem like a mythical creature, pink dolphins do exist in the Amazon region.\n\nThe Amazon river dolphin is a giant among its species. It can measure up to 2 meters long and weigh around 204 kilograms. Size isn't the only thing that sets the Amazon river dolphin apart. Thriving in South American rivers and temporary lakes caused by seasonal flooding, this freshwater dolphin is sometimes shockingly pink.\n\nAlthough born gray, males of the species are easily identified as they enter adulthood by a decisive pink shade. Their unusual coloring is believed to be the result of scar tissue from dolphin fights—whether playfighting or a serious bid for a mate. The deeper the pink, the more attractive the males are believed to be, and the older the male, the more pink it will have.\n\nThere's also a theory that this color helps the dolphins more readily blend in with their surroundings. During heavy rains, rivers along the Amazon rainforest turn a pink shade, and with it male dolphins are harder to detect. The Amazon wetland system, fed by the Amazon River, is a crucial place for pink dolphins to breed, and since 2018 has been granted internationally protected status.\n\nIn a new Merrill Lynch/Age Wave survey, a full 70% of the early adults said they received financial support from their parents in the past year and 58% said they couldn't afford their current lifestyles without it. The most common types of financial support include cell phone plans, food, school costs and car expenses. Parental financial support of early adults, said Ken Dychtwald, CEO of Age Wave, is \"the new normal\".\n\nBut 64% of the young adults surveyed said parents' financial support to children age 25 to 34 is \"a bad thing\", because it makes those kids dependent. By contrast, only 29% thought supporting men and women age 18 to 24 is bad; the remaining 71% thought that assistance \"helps the adult children get ahead\".\n\nDychtwald believes the young women and men surveyed were saying that by 25, younger adults ought to be financially independent. In fact, the respondents said, financial independence defines adulthood. \"Financial independence is something they were struggling with and challenged by. And it scared them a bit,\" Dychtwald said. One big reason they're struggling is attributed to college loans, of which the average amounts to $37,000. Many of the parents have taken on college loans for the kids, too, sometimes at the expense of their own finances. In the survey, 60% of early adults define financial success as being debt-free. Whether that's likely, or even possible, anytime soon, is anyone's guess.",

      "passage_content": "A. How will we all keep busy when we only have to work 15 hours a week? That was the question that worried the British economist John Maynard Keynes when he wrote his short essay \"Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren\" in 1930. Over the next century, he predicted, the economy would become so productive that people would barely need to work at all. For a while, it looked like Keynes was right. In 1930 the average working week was 47 hours in the United States. But by 1970, the number of hours Americans worked on average had fallen to slightly less than 39.\n\nB. But then something changed. Instead of continuing to decline, the duration of the working week remained stable. It has stayed at just below 40 hours for nearly five decades. So what happened? Why are people working just as much today as in 1970?\n\nC. There would be no mystery in this if Keynes had been wrong about the power of technology to increase the economy's productivity, which he thought would lead to a standard of living \"between four and eight times as high as it is today.\" But Keynes got that right: Technology has made the economy massively more productive. According to Benjamin M. Friedman, an economist at Harvard, the U.S. economy is right on track to reach Keynes's eightfold multiple by 2029. That is a century after the last data Keynes would have had access to.\n\nD. In a new paper, Friedman tries to figure out why that increased productivity has not translated into increased leisure time. Perhaps people just never feel materially satisfied, always wanting more money to buy the next new thing. This is a theory that appeals to many economists. \"This argument is, at best, far from sufficient,\" he writes. If that were the case, why did the duration of the working week decline in the first place?\n\nE. Another theory Friedman considers is that, in an era of ever fewer settings that provide effective opportunities for personal connections and relationships, people may place more value on the socializing that happens at work. There is support for this theory. Many people today consider colleagues as friends. But Friedman argues that the evidence for this theory is far from conclusive. Many workers report that they would like to spend more time with family, rather than at work Furthermore, this theory cannot explain the change in trend in the U.S. working week in the 1970s.\n\nF. A third possibility proves more convincing for Friedman. That is, American inequality means that the gains of increasing productivity are not widely shared by everyone. In other words, most Americans are too poor to work less. Unlike the other two explanations Friedman considers, this one fits chronologically. Inequality declined in America during the period following World War II, along with the duration of the working week. But since the early 1970s it has risen dramatically.\n\nG. Keynes's prediction of a shorter working week rests on the idea that the standard of living would continue rising for everyone. But Friedman says that this is not what has happened. Although Keynes's eight-fold figure holds up for the economy as a whole, it is not at all the case for the median American worker. For them, output by 2029 is likely to be around 3.5 times what it was when Keynes was writing. This is a bit below his four-to eight-fold predicted range.\n\nH. This can be seen in the median workers income over this time period complete with a shift in 1973 that fits in precisely with when the working week stopped shrinking. According to Friedman, between 1947 and 1973, the average hourly wage for normal workers (those who were not in management roles) in private industries other than agriculture nearly doubled in terms of what their money could buy. But by 2013 the average hourly wage for ordinary workers had fallen 5 percent from the 1973 level in terms of actual purchasing Power. Thus, though American incomes may have gone up since 1973, the amount that American workers can actually buy with their money has gone down. For most Americans, then, the magic of increasing productivity stopped working around 1973.Thus, they had to keep working just as much in order to maintain their standard of living.\n\nI. What Keynes predicted was a very optimistic version of what economists call technological unemployment. This is the idea that less labor will be necessary because machines can do so much. In Keynes's vision, the resulting unemployment would be distributed more or less evenly across society in the form of increased leisure. But Friedman says that, for Americans, reality is much darker. Americans now have a labor market in which millions of people — those with fewer skills and less education — are seeking whatever poorly paid work they can get. This is confirmed by a recent poll that found that, for half of hourly workers, their top concern is not that they work too much but that they work too little. This is most likely not because they like their jobs so much. Rather, we can assume it is because they need the money.\n\nJ. This explanation leaves an important question. If the very rich — the workers who have reaped above-average gains from the increased productivity since Keynes's time — can afford to work less, why do they continue to work so much? (Indeed, research has shown that the highest earners in America tend to work the most.) Friedman believes that for many top earners, work is a labor of love. They are doing work they care about and are interested in, and doing more of it is not necessarily a burden. For them, it may even be a pleasure. These top earners derive meaning from their jobs and work is an important part of how they think of themselves. And, of course, they are compensated for it at a level that makes it worth their while.\n\nK. Friedman concludes that the prosperity Keynes predicted is here. After all, the economy as a whole has grown even more brilliantly than he expected. But for most Americans, that prosperity is nowhere to be seen. And, as a result, neither are those shorter working weeks.",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nLao Zi once said, \"Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.\"\n\nPeople-pleasing, or seeking self-worth through others' approval, is unproductive and an exhausting way to go through life. Why do we allow what others think of us to have so much power over how we feel about ourselves? If it's true that you can't please all people all of the time, wouldn't it make sense to stop trying?\n\nUnfortunately, sense often isn't driving our behavior. For social beings who desire love and belonging, wanting to be liked, and caring about the effect we have on others, is healthy and allows us to make connections. However, where we get into trouble is when our self-worth is dependent upon whether we win someone's approval or not.\n\nThis need to be liked can be traced back to when we were children and were completely dependent on others to take care of us. Small children are not just learning how to walk and communicate, they are also trying to learn how the world works. We learn about who we are and what is expected of us based on interactions with others so, to a four-year-old, if Mommy or Daddy doesn't like him or her, there is the danger that they will abandon them. We need to understand that when we desperately want someone to approve of us, it's being driven by that little kid part of us that is still terrified of abandonment.\n\nAs you become more capable of providing yourself with the approval you seek, your need for external validation will start to vanish, leaving you stronger, more confident, and yes, happier in your life. Imagine how much time we lose each moment we restrain our authentic selves in an effort to be liked.\n\nIf we base our worth on the opinions of others, we cheat ourselves of the power to shape our experiences and embrace life not only for others but also for ourselves, because ultimately, there is no difference. So embrace the cliché and love yourself as it's highly doubtful that you'll regret it.\n\nPassage Two\n\nSome people have said aging is more a slide into forgetfulness than a journey towards wisdom. However, a growing body of research suggests that late-in-life learning is possible. In reality, education does an aging brain good.\n\nThroughout life, people's brains constantly renovate themselves. In the late 1960s, British brain scientist Geoffrey Raisman spied growth in damaged brain regions of rats through an electron microscope; their brains were forging new connections. This meant brains may change every time a person learns something new.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean the brain isn't affected by the effects of time. Just as height usually declines over the years, so does brain volume: Humans lose about 4 percent every decade starting in their 40s. But that reduction doesn't necessarily make people think slower; as long as we are alive and functioning, we can alter our brains with new information and experiences.\n\nIn fact, scientists now suspect accumulating novel experiences, facts, and skills can keep people's minds more flexible. New pathways can strengthen our ever-changing mental structure, even as the brain shrinks.\n\nConventional fixes like word puzzles and brain-training apps can contribute to mental durability. Even something as simple as taking a different route to the grocery store or going somewhere new on vacation can keep the brain healthy.\n\nA desire for new life challenges can further boost brainpower. Research about aging adults who take on new enterprises shows improved function and memory as well as a reduced risk of mental disease. Openness — a characteristic defined by curiosity and a desire for knowledge — may also help folks pass brain tests. Some folks are born with this take-in-the-world attitude, but those who aren't as genetically gifted aren't necessarily out of luck. While genes can encourage an interest in doing new things, a 2012 study in the journal Psychology and Aging found completing reasoning tasks like puzzles and number games can enhance that desire for novel experiences, which can, in turn, refresh the brain. That's why brain scientist Richard Kennedy says \"It's not that old dogs can't learn new tricks. It's that maybe old dogs don't realize why they should.\"",
