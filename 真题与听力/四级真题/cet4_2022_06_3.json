      "correct_answer": "The school clinic has been playing a critical role in our campus life. However, with university lockdown, problems have emerged. Therefore, I, a junior from Law School, am writing to make a proposal on improving its service. The problems and suggestions are as follows. First of all, many kinds of vaccines are only available at off-campus hospitals, which is quite inconvenient. Since our school hospital has professional doctors, why not provide relevant vaccination services on campus? Secondly, it has been quite tiring and time-consuming to have a thorough physical check-up owing to the huge number of students. Hence, an appointment App or a similar system will be indispensable to improve efficiency. In addition, it will be better if necessary emergency medical aid training can be offered. The commitment of our school clinic is appreciated by all students and faculty. I sincerely hope that my proposal can be adopted and our school clinic can provide better healthcare services.",

He waited and waited day after day, only to have the field waste rather than a second hare. Therefore, people all laughed at him for taking the accidental for the inevitable.",
