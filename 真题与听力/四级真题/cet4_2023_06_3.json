      "passage_content": "A. The first thing you notice in the staircase to the fourth-floor studio on Canal Street in Manhattan, New York, is the measured thumping (嘭嘭声) coming from behind a metal door. Just beyond the entrance, large lion masks were twisting and turning to the drum-beat. On a recent Friday evening, the teenagers made their way across the studio floor as they practiced Chinese lion dancing.\n\nB. \"You want to play in a circle,\" Victor Fong, aged 24, told his students at the New York Chinese Freemasons Athletic Club. \"Take it slow and do it again.\" The dance group, made up of 60 members, performs throughout the year but was now preparing for its biggest events, Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, which will begin on Saturday and conclude on February 15. Teenagers comprise about half of the group, many of whom began lion dancing at the age of 14. About 100 current and past members of the dance group—which has been performing since 1956—will be among the 220 groups marching through Chinatown in Manhattan for the 18th Lunar New Year Parade on February 5.\n\nC. Mr. Fong has been involved in the organization since he was 15 and began teaching lion dancing three years ago. But the club also acts as a recreation center and safe haven (庇护所) for teenagers, with video games readily available. As many as 20 students show up after school. \"The basic requirement for hanging out here is you have to learn how to lion dance,\" Mr. Fong said. While that is not a formal requirement for being a member, everyone finds a way to participate in the Lunar New Year Parade, whether it's by dancing, carrying a flag or beating a drum.\n\nD. Alvin Chau, aged 26, is an environmental consultant by day and a lion dancer on weekends. He has been a club member for 10 years and joined because of an interest in lion dance. \"We're a big family,\" he said, shaking hands with other members as they walked through the door. \"You know everyone.\"\n\nE. It is believed that the lion dance began in the third century. Stories vary about how lion dancing came to be, but most of them include a monster named Nian who would terrorize a village. The villagers finally banded together and scared the beast away with firecrackers (爆竹) and drums. While lions are not native to China, some versions of the story include the villagers creating a monster of their own in the shape of a lion to fight off the beast.\n\nF. Today, the dancers travel across Chinatown going from business to business to bring good luck for the coming year. The new year-according to the Chinese lunar calendar-will begin on Saturday and marks the Year of the Rooster (鸡年), which is thought to be a symbol of positivity. \"It's almost like the dark night is ending and the sun is coming up,\" said Ya Yung Teng, the digital collections coordinator for the Museum of Chinese in America. \"It's hopeful that we're going to have a new day.\" Roosters and chickens are not particularly strong creatures, Ms. Teng said, but they are numerous. \"In a way,\" she said, the rooster \"stands for \"We the People.\"\"\n\nG. The lion head and tail are operated by two people. As one person controls the head, a second follows under a train of fabric representing the body. The dancers move in harmony as they imitate the animal's natural movements in the wild, including the aggressiveness of an attack. A lion head figure weighs under 10 pounds and sits squarely on the dancer's shoulders. Inside, the dancer manipulates strings that open and close the lion's eyes, shake its ears and open its mouth to reveal a fire-orange tongue.\n\nH. \"A good lion dancer will imitate a living creature,\" said Karlin Chan, aged 59, who heads the athletic club's community public relations. \"I started lion dancing when I was a kid,\" he said. \"Chinatown was much smaller then and it was a celebration with fireworks and firecrackers, which added a lot of flavor and meaning to it.\"\n\nI. Mr. Chan buys a new lion head each year when he travels to China. A head costs about $ 1,500. \"If you want the good stuff, the quality, you have to see it for yourself,\" he said. \"I'll inspect the product before we put it in the container and ship it over.\" Mr. Chan, who has been involved with the club for nearly 50 years, said that passing the dance from one generation to the next was vital. \"You need to pass on the traditions and the culture, and this is a part of our culture,\" he said. \"It's a great way to promote cultural understanding and exchange; we welcome that.\"\n\nJ. For Sara Pore, aged 17, another club member, lion dance is more than just tradition, it provides a creative outlet. \"Lion dancing started 2,000 years ago—that's incredible,\" she said. \"But what makes you a competent lion dancer is that there's a sense of imagination involved. Lion dancing teaches competence in leadership because of this. You're constantly forced to push yourself past your limit.\"\n\nK. Back at rehearsal (排练), Justin Le, aged 18, tied a red ribbon around his waist to practice jumping. The dancers use the ribbons to pull themselves up over their partners' heads. The room's ceilings are too low to wear the lion heads for jumping practice, so once up on his partner's head, Mr. Le held out his arms as if in offering.\n\nL. Mr. Le comes by the dance as a legacy (传承). \"I was born into it,\" Mr. Le said, noting that his uncle and father were club members. \"Growing up, I would always watch my family and see the lion dance, and I slowly grew interested in it.\" By the age of 14, he was fully enrolled in the athletic club's lion dance group. \"I value my culture and tradition, being Chinese or Asian-American. I have a lot of pride in that,\" he said. \"I want to contribute and give back to the community.\"",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nTeam-building exercises have become popular for managers trying to increase organisational and team harmony and productivity. Unfortunately many employees resent compulsory bonding and often regard these exercises as a nuisance.\n\nA paper published this week by University of Sydney researchers in Social Networks has reported participants' feelings about team-building interventions (干预), revealing ethical implications in forcing employees to take part.\n\n\"Many people see team-building activities as a waste of time, so we decided to look in more depth at what's behind this,\" said the paper's lead researcher, Dr Peter Matous.\n\n\"Teams are formed, combined and restructured. Staff are relocated and office spaces redesigned. All this is done with the aim of improving workplace efficiency, collaboration and cohesion. But does any of this work?\" said Dr Matous.\n\nThe study found that team-building exercises which focused on the sharing of and intervening into personal attitudes and relationships between team members were considered too heavy-handed and intrusive, although the researchers say some degree of openness and vulnerability is often necessary to make deep, effective connections with colleagues.\n\n\"Some participants were against team-building exercises because they were implicitly compulsory. They didn't welcome management's interest in their lives beyond their direct work performance,\" said Matous. \"Many people don't want to be forced into having fun or making friends, especially not on top of their busy jobs. They feel management is being too nosy or trying to control their lives too much.\"\n\nIn this study the researchers recommended a self-disclosure （表露）approach where participants were guided through a series of questions that allowed them to increasingly disclose personal information and values. The method is well-tested and has been shown to increase interpersonal closeness. However, to be successful it must be voluntary.\n\nThe researchers said there are numerous schools of thought that propose differing psychological methods for strengthening relationships. \"With caution, many relational methods to improve teams and organisations can be borrowed from other fields. The question is how to apply them effectively to strengthen an entire collective, which is more than just the sum of individual relationships,\" said Dr Matous.\n\nPassage Two\n\nThere are close to 58,000 homeless people in Los Angeles county. That's a shocking and tragic number for a region that's home to some of the richest people in the world. At last, the problem became so acute-and so visible-that Los Angeles took extraordinary action. The citizens of this county voted in November 2016 and again in March 2017 to raise their own taxes. The purpose of such action is to fund an enormous multibillion-dollar, 10-year program of housing and social services for the homeless.\n\nAs a result, Los Angeles now has its best chance in decades to combat homelessness. This is an opportunity that surely all can agree must not be wasted. It is neither desirable nor morally acceptable nor practical for this county to tolerate the signs of deprivation more commonly associated with the slums (贫民窟) of Rio de Janiero.\n\nHow did we get here? For as long as there are homeless people, there is a tendency to blame the victims themselves for their condition—to see their failure to thrive as an issue of character, of moral weakness, of laziness. But contrary to popular belief, the homeless in Los Angeles are not mostly mentally ill or drug addicted or frightening, although a sizable minority meet some of those descriptions. Today, a greater and greater proportion of people living on the streets are there because of bad luck or a series of mistakes, or because the economy forgot them—they lost a job or were evicted (逐出) or fled an abusive marriage just as the housing market was growing increasingly unforgiving.\n\nThe challenges are enormous, even if everyone is pulling in the same direction. That reality was driven home this month by a new Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority report showing that the county's homeless population is growing faster than the supply of new housing.\n\nIn the world's richest nation, homelessness on this scale should be shameful and shocking. But most Los Angeles residents are no longer either shocked or shamed. Increasingly, we are uncomfortable, annoyed, disgusted, scared or unaware. Compassion (同情心) is being replaced by resignation.",

      "correct_answer": "The Chinese government has been vigorously carrying out compulsory education all the time so that every child can have access to education. Since the Compulsory Education Law came into effect in 1986, the government has worked diligently to achieve the goal of making compulsory education available throughout the country. Today, children in China, starting school at the age of six, receive a total of nine years of compulsory education from primary school to junior high school. Since the fall semester of 2008, students during compulsory education don't have to pay tuition fees. With the implementation of a series of educational reform measures, the quality of China's compulsory education has also been significantly improved.",
