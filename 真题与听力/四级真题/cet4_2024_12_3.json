      "passage_content": "A) Most people have a dream in life, a vision of who or what they'd like to be in the future. At a minimum, everyone has interests and values that determine what they want out of their lives. Even so, trying to set achievable goals that you'll work for over the course of many years can be extremely challenging. It can be hard to know where to even begin, and the things you hope to achieve may seem impossible. But if you're well prepared you may be able to set goals for your life that are just as fulfilling to work toward as to achieve.\n\nB) We all have goals that we want to achieve in our lives. These goals may include learning a new language, eating healthier and losing weight becoming a better parent, saving more money, and so on. It can be easy to assume that the gap between where you are now and where you want to be in the future is caused by a lack of knowledge. This is why we buy courses on how to start a business or how to lose weight fast or how to learn a new language in three months. We assume that if we knew about a better strategy, then we would get better results. We believe that a new result requires new knowledge.\n\nC) What I'm starting to realize, however, is that new knowledge does not necessarily drive new results. In fact, learning something new can actually be a waste of time if your goal is to make progress and not simply gain additional knowledge.\n\nD) It all comes down to the difference between learning and practicing. Thomas Sterner, in his book The Practicing Mind, explains the key difference between practicing and learning. He says: \"When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal.\" Here the words \"deliberate\" and \"intention\" are key, because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it.\n\nE) Learning something new and practicing something new may seem very similar but these two methods can have profoundly different results. Here are some additional ways to think about the difference. Let's say your goal is to get stronger and more fit. You can research the best instructions on weight lifting technique, but the only way to build strength is to practice lifting weights. Let's say your goal is to grow your startup. You can learn about the best way to make a sales pitch, but the only way to actually land customers is to practice making sales calls. Let's say your goal is to write a book. You can talk to a best-selling author about writing, but the only way to become a better writer is to practice publishing consistently.\n\nF) Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skill. Let's consider a couple more reasons to prioritize active practice over passive learning. First, passive learning can be a stick that supports inaction. In many cases, learning is actually a way to avoid taking action on the goals and interests that we say are important to us. For example, let's say you want to learn a foreign language. Reading a book on how to learn a foreign language quickly allows you to feel like you are making progress (\"Hey, I'm figuring out the best way to do this!\"). Of course, you're not actually practicing the action that would deliver your desired outcome (speaking the foreign language).\n\nG) In situations like this one, we often claim that we are preparing or researching the best method, but these rationalizations allow us to feel like we are moving forward when we are merely spinning our wheels. We make the mistake of being in motion rather than taking action. Learning is valuable until it becomes a form of procrastination (拖延).\n\nH) Another point to consider is that practice is learning, but learning is not practice. Passive learning is not a form of practice because although you gain new knowledge, you are not discovering how to apply that knowledge. Active practice, meanwhile, is one of the greatest forms of learning because the mistakes you make while practicing reveal important insights.\n\nI) Even more importantly, practice is the only way to make a meaningful contribution with your knowledge. You can watch an online course about how to build a business or read an article about a terrible disaster in a developing nation, but that knowledge is unproductive unless you actually launch your business or donate to those in need. Learning by itself can be valuable for you but if you want to be valuable to others, then you have to express your knowledge in some way.\n\nJ) The last important point to consider is that practice focuses your energy on the process. Thomas Sterner once said, \"Progress is a natural result of staying focused on the process of doing anything.\" The state of your life right now is a result of the habits and beliefs that you have been practicing each day. When you realize this and begin to direct your focus toward practicing better habits day-in and day-out, continual progress will be the logical outcome. It is not the things we learn nor the dreams we visualize that determine our results, but rather the habits that we practice each day. Fall in love with boredom and focus your energy on the process, not the product.\n\nK) What does this all mean? Is passive learning useless? Of course not. In many cases, learning for the sake of learning can be a beautiful thing. Not to mention that soaking up new information can help you make more informed decisions when you do decide to take action. That said, the main point of this article is that learning by itself does not lead to progress. We often hide behind information and use learning as an excuse to delay the more difficult and more important choice of actually doing something. Spend less time passively learning and more time actively practicing. Stop thinking and start doing.",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nResearch in human-vehicle interaction has shown even systems designed to automate driving are far from being error-proof. Recent evidence points to drivers' limited understanding of what these systems can and cannot do as a contributing factor to system misuse. A recent study tackles the issue of over-trusting drivers and the resulting system misuse from a legal viewpoint. It looks at what the manufacturers of self-driving cars should legally do to ensure that drivers understand how to use the vehicles appropriately.\n\nOne solution suggested in the study involves requiring buyers to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), similar to the terms and conditions that require agreement when using new software products. But this is far from ideal. The agreement may not provide enough information to the driver, leading to confusion about the nature of the requests for agreement and their implications. Further, most end users don't read EULAs. A 2017 study shows 91 percent of people agree to them without reading. Among young people, 97 percent agree without reviewing the terms.\n\nThe issue is that, unlike using a smartphone app, operating a car has serious safety risks, whether the driver is human or software. And human drivers need to consent to take responsibility for the outcomes of the software and hardware.\n\n\"Warning fatigue\" and distracted driving are also causes for concern. For example, a driver, annoyed after receiving continuous warnings, could decide to just ignore the message. Or, if the message is presented while the vehicle is in motion, it could represent a distraction. Given these limitations and concerns, even if this mode of obtaining consent is to move forward, it likely won't fully protect automakers from their legal liability should the system malfunction (发生故障) or an accident occur.\n\nDriver training for self-driving vehicles can help ensure that drivers fully understand system capabilities and limitations. This needs to occur beyond the vehicle purchase. Recent evidence shows even relying on the information provided by the seller is not going to answer many questions. All of this considered, the road forward for self-driving cars is not going to be a smooth ride after all.\n\nPassage Two\n\nDo you ever blend up a protein drink for breakfast or grab a protein bar following an afternoon workout? If so, you are likely among the millions of people in search of more protein-rich diets.\n\nProtein-enriched products are found everywhere. But contrary to all the publicity that everyone needs more protein, most Americans get twice as much as they need.\n\nMany of us living in the most developed countries are buying into a myth of protein deficiency created by food companies and self-identified health experts. Global retail sales of protein supplement products reached an astonishing US$18.9 billion in 2020.\n\nBut are we really in need of more protein? Physicians in the U.S. have never actually examined a patient with protein deficiency because simply by eating an adequate number of daily calories we are also most likely getting enough protein.\n\nIn fact, Americans currently consume almost twice the National Academy of Medicine's recommended daily intake of protein although the most desirable protein intake may vary depending on age and activity level.\n\nFor example, if you're a dedicated athlete you might need to consume higher quantities of protein. Generally, though, a 140-pound person should not exceed 120 grams of protein per day, particularly because a high protein diet can strain kidney and liver function and increase risks of developing heart disease and cancer.\n\nWhile fats and sugar have taken the beating in turns since over a century ago, protein has managed to remain our red-hot favorite.\n\nIn the 1970s through the 1990s, protein products remained visible but moved back somewhat with the dietary spotlight firmly fixed on low-calorie, low-fat, sugar-free snack foods and beverages following the publication of studies linking sugar and saturated (饱和的) fat consumption to heart disease.\n\nLater research in 2003, however, suggested high-protein diets could aid in weight loss, and protein quickly regained its former nutrient-superstar status.\n\nNow most people living in high-income nations are consuming enough protein. When we replace meals with a protein bar or drink, we also risk missing out on the rich sources of antioxidants (抗氧化剂), vitamins and many other benefits of real food.",
