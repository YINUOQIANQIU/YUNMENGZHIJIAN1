But it is impossible to know the ______ day on which he was born. Church records show he's baptized (施洗礼) on April 26, and 3 days was a customary amount of time to wait before baptizing a newly born baby. Shakespeare's date of death is ______ known, however: it was April 23, 1616. He was 52 and had retired to Stratford three years before. Although few plays have been performed or analyzed as extensively as the 38 plays Shakespeare wrote, there are few surviving details about his life. This ______ of biographical information is due primarily to his social ______: he was not a noble, but the son of a leather trader. Shakespeare ______ attended the grammar school in Stratford, where he would have studied Latin and read ______ literature. He did not go to university and at age 18 married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his ______. They had four children, including the twins, Hammet and Judith. Nothing is known of the period between the birth of the twins and Shakespeare's ______ as a dramatist in London in the early 1590s. In a million words written over 20 years, he ______ the full range of human emotions and conflicts with a ______ that remains sharp today.

      "passage_content": "A. Humans are creatures of habit. We love to establish a routine and stick with it. Then we often put ourselves on auto-pilot. Routines can be incredibly useful in helping you get things done. However, too much of a routine can also make you incredibly boring. Nevertheless, many people live lives that are boringly predictable, or live a life where everything is outlined or planned.\n\nB. To tell the truth, interesting people are more popular among their friends. If you don't arouse someone's curiosity or brighten someone's day, you probably come across as being a little bit dull. But that doesn't mean your life has ended and you can't do anything to change it. If you find yourself searching for something to say beyond small talk, try these tactics to find more interesting approaches to conversation.\n\nC. Recently, I was at a gathering of colleagues when someone turned to me and asked, \"So, what's new with you?\" Ordinarily, I think I'm a good conversationalist. After all, it's literally my job to talk to people and tell their stories or share their advice. And that's not exactly an unexpected question. Still, the only \"new-to-me\" topics that came to mind were my daughter's basketball tournament (锦标赛) and my feelings about that morning's political headlines—neither amusing nor appropriate topics at that moment.\n\nD. Oh, no, I thought. Have I become boring? But sharing our experiences in an authentic way to connect with other people is what makes us interesting, says associate professor Michael Pirson. The hesitation I felt in not sharing the ordinary things that were happening in my life, and the wild mental search for something more interesting, may have backfired and made me seem less interesting.\n\nE. \"If someone is making up some conversation that might be interesting, it's probably not going to land well,\" says Pirson, whose expertise includes trust and well-being, mindfulness, and humanistic management. \"It's going to feel like a made-up conversation that people don't necessarily want to tune in to.\"\n\nF. The most interesting people aren't those who've gone on some Eat, Pray, Love journey to find themselves. Instead, Prison says, they're those who examine the ordinary. \"Often, the 'boring things' may not be boring at all. Maybe they are actually little miracles,\" he says. Share your observations about the world around you—interesting stories you heard or things you noticed—and you may be surprised by the universal connection they inspire.\n\nG. This is essentially how Jessica Hagy starts her day. The author of How to Be Interesting: An Instruction Manual, Hagy spends a lot of time thinking about what's interesting to her. People who are interesting are persistently curious, she says.\n\nH. Think about the everyday things around you and ask questions about them. What is that roadside monument I see on my way to work every day? Who built that interesting building in my city? What nearby attractions haven't I visited? Why do people do things that way? Use what you find to ask more questions and learn more about the world around you. \"Having that sort of curiosity is almost like a protective gear from getting into boredom,\" she says. And when you find things that are truly interesting to you, share them.\n\nI. Television veteran Audrey Morrissey, executive producer of NBC's The Voice, is always looking for what will make a person or story interesting to viewers: It's usually a matter of individuality. \"Having a strong point of view, signature style, or being a super-enthusiast in a particular field makes someone interesting,\" she says. That means embracing what is truly interesting or unique about yourself. \"Many people are 'not boring' in the way that they can carry a conversation or can be good at a social gathering, etc. To be interesting means that you have lived life, taken risks, traveled, sought out experience to learn for yourself and share with others,\" she says.\n\nJ. Of course, it's possible to be a fountain of knowledge and a boring person, says public relations consultant Andrea Pass. Paying attention to the listener is an important part of having a conversation that's interesting to both parties. Talking on and on about what's interesting to you isn't going to make you an interesting person, she says.\n\nK. \"If the listener is not paying attention, it's your sign to shorten the story or change direction. Make sure to bring the audience into the conversation so that it is not one-sided,\" Pass says. Be a better listener yourself, and give others opportunities to participate in the conversation by inviting them with questions or requests to share their own experiences or thoughts. (e.g., \"Now, tell me about your favorite book,\" or \"Have you ever been to that attraction?\") Questions are a powerful tool, especially when they encourage others to disclose information about themselves. A 2012 study from the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that roughly 40% of the time we are talking, we're disclosing subjective information about our experience. As a whole we're doing so, our brains are more engaged. So one strategy to leave others with the impression that you're a sparkling conversation partner is to get others to talk about themselves.\n\nL. Being relatable is also essential, Morrissey says. \"The best entertainment and storytelling comes from people who are relatable- those who don't shy away from opening up but freely share who they are and what they care about. These are the people viewers most relate to and find interesting. Being authentic, honest, and vulnerable is always interesting.\"\n\nM. I have now come to realize that being boring, in actuality, is not only about who you are as a person, but also how you present yourself. No matter what, make sure you are having fun in life. Because when you are enjoying, people around you will begin to enjoy as well. Show some interest in them and they will definitely show some in you. If you are a very reserved person, this could be a little difficult at first. But with a little effort, you can definitely improve.",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nWith obesity now affecting 29% of the population in England, and expected to rise to 35% by 2030, should we now recognise it as a disease? Obesity, in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that health may be adversely affected, meets the dictionary definition of disease, argues Professor John Wilding. He points out that more than 200 genes influence weight. \"Thus body weight is strongly influenced by biology- it is not an individual's fault if they develop obesity.\" Yet the widespread view is that obesity is self-induced and that it is entirely the individual's responsibility to do something about it. Recognising obesity as a chronic disease with severe complications rather than a lifestyle choice \"should help reduce the stigma (耻辱) and discrimination experienced by many people with obesity,\" he adds.\n\nProfessor Wilding disagrees that labelling a high proportion of the population as having a disease removes personal responsibility or may overwhelm health services, pointing out that other common diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, require people to take action to manage their condition. He suggests that most people with obesity will eventually develop complications. \"But unless we accept that obesity is a disease, we are not going to be able to tackle it,\" he concludes.\n\nBut Dr. Richard Pile, a physician with a special interest in diabetes, argues that adopting this approach \"could actually result in worse outcomes for individuals and society.\" He believes that the dictionary definition of disease \"is so vague that we can classify almost anything as a disease\" and says the question is not whether we can, but whether we should, and to what end.\n\nIf labelling obesity as a disease was harmless then it wouldn't really matter, he writes. But labelling obesity as a disease \"risks reducing autonomy, disempowering and robbing people of the intrinsic (内在的) motivation that is such an important enabler of change.\" What's more, making obesity a disease \"may not benefit patients, but it will benefit healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical (制药的) industry when health insurance and clinical guidelines promote treatment with drugs and surgery,\" he warns.\n\nPassage Two\n\nNationwide, only about three percent of early childhood teachers are male in the U. S. Experts say this can have an impact on young children whose understanding of gender roles and identity are rapidly forming. Research has found that having access to diverse teachers is beneficial for children. For the youngest learners, it means they are more likely to get exposed to different varieties of play and communication. It also helps them develop healthy ideas around gender.\n\n\"In our world and our society, we have very specific stereotypes (模式化形象) of gender roles,\" said Mindi Reich-Shapiro, an assistant professor in the teacher education department of the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and one of the authors of a recent study. \"It's important for children to see other possibilities and other paths they can take.\"\n\nDespite mostly feeling supported by colleagues and family members, many of the male educators surveyed in the study reported facing social or cultural resistance in their careers as early education teachers. Some also reported that there were parents surprised or concerned that their child had a male teacher. And they had been advised by colleagues or other staff not to hug children.\n\nReich-Shapiro and fellow researchers made several recommendations to increase male representation in the field. Low pay has long been acknowledged as a major issue in the early childhood field. Over 70% of male educators who said they intended to stay in the early education workforce noted an increased salary was a major motivating factor for them to commit to the career long-term. The report suggests paying all early childhood educators the way elementary school teachers are paid\n\nCities and programs should establish support groups for male early childhood educators and provide mentoring and professional development advice for male educators and their program leaders.\n\nThe authors also suggest that traditional recruitment approaches for early childhood educators \"do not address the gender gap in the field.\" They recommend providing young men opportunities to work with children through training and volunteer programs, targeting groups of men who are considering a career change, such as fathers.",
