Our capacity to speak, write and learn new vocabulary does not seem to ___28___ with age. Our eyesight may dim and our recall may weaken, but by comparison, our ability to produce and to ___29___ language is well preserved into older adulthood.\n\nIndeed, the latest research that has emerged on language and aging shows that language mastery is a ___30___ that we begin as infants and continue on for the rest of our lives.

      "passage_content": "A) Few topics have been so endlessly analysed as work-life balance. The quest to attain this mysterious state has dominated discussion around careers for years—especially for working parents. The concept is often presented as something to achieve, or a goal to reach. And once you've reached it, congratulations: you've made it; you're a successful human being of the 21st century.\n\nB) But the problem is that we often tell ourselves: \"I'm going to put in eight hours' worth of work, and then I'm going to put in eight hours' worth of 'me time', which will include my family, my hobbies, my workout, my everything,\" says Anat Lechner, clinical associate professor of management at New York University. \"I don't think it's such a simple formula.\"\n\nC) And, according to new findings, it may not be. Some researchers are now encouraging us to stop thinking about work-life balance as an achievement that you either hit or don't. Instead, they suggest it may be more of a lifelong process—a continuous, never-ending exercise that requires self-awareness and timely adjustments. Researchers Ioana Lupu and Mayra Ruiz-Castro argue that work-life balance is \"a cycle, not an achievement\" In their 2020 study, the researchers interviewed nearly 80 employees at two London-based firms—an equal number of men and women between the ages of 30 and 50, all with at least one dependent child—who worked in middle or senior management roles.\n\nD) Although it sounds like the respondents had a lot in common, here's what separated them: about 30% of the men and 50% of the Women reported resisting working long hours. The other respondents, meanwhile, all worked long hours because they thought that's what successful professionals should do.\n\nE) Lupu and Ruiz-Castro looked at those who rejected the long hours and they found that those workers actually had strikingly similar strategies for maintaining their work-life balance. They had a tendency to reflect and question assumptions in the name of self-awareness and regularly took steps to adjust the things standing in their way to work-life balance.\n\nF) Lupu and Ruiz-Castro identified five steps that the respondents in the study who had better work-life balance used in their jobs. First, they paused and reconsidered beliefs such as \"I'm a professional, so I should work, work, work\", and asked themselves questions like, \"What's currently causing me stress?\" Second, after identifying the cause, they zeroed in on their resultant emotions. Did they feel angry, sad, energised? Third, they reprioritised, asking \"Is working long hours really worth cutting back on family time?\", for example. Fourth, they considered their alternatives: is there anything at work that could be changed to accommodate these new priorities? And finally, they implemented changes, like asking their supervisor for greater flexibility, or deciding not to take on every project that comes their way.\n\nG) This five-step process is something anyone can adopt. Going through the steps, and constantly checking in with yourself can help you shift and adapt your professional life to something that will better harmonise with your personal one. \"Awareness of your emotional state is essential in order to determine the changes you want to make in your work and in your life,\" says Lupu.\n\nH) New York University's Lechner agrees that finding that balance is an ongoing pursuit. It's not simply about dividing up the hours in your day between work, the gym, kids and chores. If the underlying emotional sources of stress are still there, then the time you actually spend at home may not be enjoyable. \"We come home and even though physically we are there, mentally we still may be processing things that happened at work. We're not present,\" she says. What we call \"work-life balance\" is actually just a substitute to having a sense of fulfillment and contentment.\n\nI) Of course, finding that balance probably shouldn't be something you have to do by yourself. Research by Erin Kelly, professor of work and organisation studies at MIT, shows companies and managers can play a key role in creating a better environment for workers. For her book Overload: How Good Jobs Went Bad and What to Do about It, she and co-author Phyllis Moen split more than 1,000 employees at a Fortune 500 company into two groups, one that worked under a management redesign and one that continued working within the existing management structure.\n\nJ) Under the management redesign, many steps were taken to ensure better work-life balance and prevent burnout. Managers were regularly reminded to explicitly support their employees. Workers were allowed to make changes, like cancelling 9 am meetings. All of this was done in the name of increasing job satisfaction and giving workers greater flexibility, and to assure workers that it was something management was committed to. Unsurprisingly, Kelly and Moen found that employees in the redesign group reported less stress and less burnout. They were less likely to quit their jobs; indeed, over the next four years, they were 40% less likely to quit than those who kept working under the old policies.\n\nK) \"Work-life balance is understood to be an individual's response, so people think 'it's up to me to manage the craziness of my work life'\", says Kelly. But organisations need to examine the demands they're placing on employees. \"The root problem is not how the two pieces of work and life come together. It's that we have unrealistic expectations of what we're asked to do on the work side.\" If your workplace isn't an environment where work-life balance is possible in the first place, any effort you attempt to make toward it on a personal level will be in vain.\n\nL) That's a conversation that appears to be gathering pace. The new prevalence of remote and flexible working models will likely all play important roles in how we balance our professional and personal lives. And if it seems like finding that perfect balance remains difficult to achieve, the experts say that keeping some perspective can help. For millions of people, work is about being able to put food on the table. Talking about work-life balance \"is a very privileged conversation\", says Lechner. \"If we're reflecting, maybe we should also reflect on that.\"",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nThe weakening of the human connection to nature might be good for economic growth but is bad for people. A tipping point was reached in 2020 when human-made materials — such as steel, concrete and plastic — were found to weigh more than all life on Earth. Continuing to grow concrete forests rather than real ones is shortsighted. Simply being in the nearest wood has such health benefits that the Woodland Trust successfully lobbied for it to be prescribed by doctors.\n\nYet slipping from popular culture is the wonder and beauty of the natural world. For every three nature-related words in hit songs of the 1950s, researchers found, there was only slightly more than one 50 years later. It is not a moment too soon that teenagers will be able to take a natural history test given that for decades children have been able to name more video game characters than wildlife species.\n\nPart of remedying this social disease would be for parliament to pass a \"right to grow\" law, allowing anyone to turn underused public spaces into vegetable and fruit gardens. The idea is for people to get back in touch with the soil — while producing food sustainably.\n\nVegetable planting has a respectable tradition. In April 1649, locals responded to high prices and food shortages by cultivating vegetables on common land in Southern England. The practice of throwing seed bombs to turn vacant plots of land green took off in 1970s New York, and has been revived by green-thumbed social media influencers who defy local US regulations in a war on ugly spots in cities.\n\nApart from the urgent task of providing more healthy nutrients to those who increasingly can't afford them. Publicly accessible fruit and vegetable gardens connect what we eat to where it comes from—the means of production, if you will. They can make unlovely spaces lovely, and marry use and beauty as well as help promote a sense of community. Plants are also, of course, our first defense against species loss and climate change. Such planting is a small step for humanity — in the right direction.\n\nPassage Two\n\nEngineering in the U.S. has long been a male-dominated profession. Fifty years ago, it looked like that might change.\n\nIn 1970, the percentage of women majoring in engineering was less than 1%. In 1979, that number was 9%. Many hoped women would continue to enter the field at the same rate. But that's not what happened. Today, only 21% of engineering majors are women, a number largely unchanged since 2000.\n\nI am a historian who, along with my colleagues, surveyed 251 women engineers who graduated from college in the 1970s. These pioneers reflected on the challenges they faced — and had advice for women entering the field today.\n\nOne survey taker explained, \"The greatest challenge for me was continuing to believe in myself, when all the messages I was getting were that I would never be taken seriously or promoted or given raises at the same rate as men, who were clearly less qualified and not as smart as I was.\"\n\nA chemical engineer who worked in manufacturing agreed, \"You have to prove yourself just because you are female. And you have to work twice as hard!\"\n\nA civil engineer said, \"We are 'women engineers.' People don't refer to a man as a 'man engineer' — he's an engineer. We are constantly reminded that we don't truly belong.\" Another civil engineer stated, \"On many levels, you're never quite one of the groups.\"\n\nWomen also talked about family caregiving responsibilities. A retired vice president from a major chemical company stated, \"Young women engineers are on an equal footing until they have children, then they struggle to balance work and family—and compete with men who don't have the same household responsibilities.\"\n\nBut over the years, things have changed a lot. Young women engineers are more accepted mostly because there are just more of them. Many women engineers hailed the benefits of their chosen career. A program manager in manufacturing stated that engineering is the best degree. A mechanical engineer said, \"It will give you the flexibility to do almost anything. It is also satisfying to see the effects of what you have done.\"",
