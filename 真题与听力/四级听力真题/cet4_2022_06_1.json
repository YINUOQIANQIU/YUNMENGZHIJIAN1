They are advertised as a way for adults to finish their education and students to learn the material at their own pace—it is far more compatible for people with busy schedules.\\n\\nBut after being enrolled in an online course last fall semester, I came to realize online classes were merely a means to fulfil course requirements.\\n\\nFirst of all, students lack the desire to learn, and they simply complete their assignments to receive credit for a passing grade rather than genuinely engage with the course material.\\n\\nAs online courses tend to have more than 100 students, most of the assignments are short and simple. They are not designed for students to interact with the material in depth but designed to be graded easily to accommodate such a large number of students.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest disadvantage of taking an online class is the absence of face-to-face interaction between the teacher and their students. Live sessions are infrequent and are often scheduled during the middle of the day when students have to attend other classes or work. The office hours of the professor may also be during inconvenient times for many students as well. Most interaction with the professor has to be through email which is often impersonal. It is nearly impossible for students to build a relationship with their professor.\\n\\nThere is also little interaction amongst students. It can be harder for students to create study groups and form relationships with their peers.\\n\\nOnline classes also require either a computer or laptop and a reliable internet connection. Not all students have access to these types of resources, whether it is for financial or other reasons, and some students can be put at a disadvantage.\\n\\nOffering online classes certainly helps students who would otherwise not be able to attend classroom sessions.

When debates in any sector move beyond the halls of universities and government agencies, there's potential for information to be used incorrectly, leading to public confusion; yet, open debate can also promote communication between the scientific community and the public. Recent open debates on scientific research, health, and policy have aroused greater public attention and encouraged more diverse voices. If this trend spurs scientists to agree more quickly about the best solutions to our problems—and at the same time helps the public observe the process of scientific discourse more clearly—then this is good for everyone, including scientists.\\n\\nA recent debate published in The New York Times discussed the question of how quickly medicine should be developed and produced. Issues such as safety of the product and perception of the public were examined and considered. But some experts worried that such public speculation might lead people to believe that disagreement about the details meant a lack of adequate scientific consensus over the safety and efficiency of modern-day medicine.\\n\\nThe anxiety seems misplaced. Gone are the days of going to a conference and debating scientific issues, and that's good because those gatherings were not diverse enough and excluded many important voices. These days, the public can access debates about science regardless of where they take place.\\n\\nFor many scientists, public debate is a new frontier and it may feel like a place with few restraints or rules, but rather than avoiding such conversations, let the debates be transparent and vigorous, wherever they are held. If the public is to understand that science is an honorably self-correcting process, the idea that science is a fixed set of facts in a textbook needs to be dismissed.
