New findings suggest that the kinds of complex and strategic self-presentation behaviour we see in adults appear at a much younger age than previously known.\\n\\nResearch shows that a child's awareness of social standing comes from adults. Like grown-ups, kids want to be accepted by those they admire. Interactive experiences may provide opportunities for children to learn about what constitutes a desirable reputation and the kinds of strategies that are effective for building a good reputation in their social environment.\\n\\nFive-year-olds aren't just aware of their reputations, they also behave strategically to alter their outward image. They will vary their behaviour in order to appear moral or socially good in the eyes of key observers. While we know that adults use a large variety of attributes to manage and create impressions, we don't yet know whether children understand and use the fact that different attributes are valuable at different times to different audiences.

Experts say too much happiness can stop the bears from searching for new mates.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists have long believed that building roads or homes near the bears may threaten their survival by \\\"reducing or fragmenting their natural habitats\\\", The Times reported. But the new research suggests that a \\\"modest degree of discomfort and fragmentation\\\" may actually help preserve panda populations.\\n\\nThe research was conducted by scientists from Michigan State University. It concluded that pandas fail to wander off in search of new mates if they find their habitat too comfortable, resulting in a lack of vital genetic diversity.\\n\\nFor their study — outlined in a paper in the journal Conservation Biology — the team looked at genetic diversity and spread among a Chinese panda population. The ideal level of perfectly livable habitat was found to be only 80% of an area, with the remainder either too harsh or too affected by human activity.\\n\\nThe experts concluded that pandas should ideally \\\"be happy enough to thrive, but not so content that they don't want to move around and find new mates\\\".\\n\\nTheir conclusions about what The Guardian described as this \\\"sweet spot\\\" are in line with the so-called Goldilocks principle: that there can be just the right amount of something.

But what about those of us who don't have a natural talent? We've been told all our lives that if you work hard, you too can succeed. But with the release of Angela Duckworth's Grit, we are given a new key to success.\\n\\n\\\"As much as talent counts, effort counts twice,\\\" says Duckworth in Grit. She introduces a new concept that talent may be overrated, and if you want real success, what you need is grit the perfect combination of passion and persistence. Even if you have natural talent it's nothing without grit.\\n\\nDuckworth says grit is the difference between success and failure. A person who has grit is more likely to succeed than a person who does not. When we think about attaining success — whether it's landing that job or learning that new skill — our thoughts are immediately burdened by all the things we must first learn. If you want that new job, you have to learn the job skills, then the interview skills, then the dress part — and you must be perfect at all of them. Grit is different because it tells us that perfection isn't the goal.\\n\\nGrit lifts the unreasonable expectations off our shoulders. Grit tells us that the door is open wider than we first thought possible. Grit allows us to redefine our goals. Think about it: what's something you've always wanted to do, but gave up because you \\\"don't have the skills for it\\\"? What's something you love but aren't good at?\\n\\nThe real workings of grit are to have sustainable passion and continue to try. Effort means more than your natural ability. Even if you haven't mastered a skill, grit tells you that you can still succeed if you can transform your passion into action. In a way, Duckworth is giving new hope to people who have shut the doors on their dreams. She is saying it is possible that you can accomplish anything.
