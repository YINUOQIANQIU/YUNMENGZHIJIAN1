Once upon a time, it was just customary for a bride to take her groom's last name as her own and abandon her maiden name completely. The act of keeping her own last name was considered taboo and people's eyebrows would raise right off their faces when they found out that the bride was even considering something so radical. Over time, though, more and more women are deciding to keep their last names.\"}, {\"letter\": \"C\", \"content\": \"There are a lot of reasons to want to keep your own last name. Hopefully you have a supportive groom who understands why this idea is the most appealing to you. A lot of times, though, the act of keeping your name is still something that causes concern.

You could choose an entirely new last name for the two of you to share. This way neither of you gets \\\"your\\\" way and you both have to deal with the legalities of going through a name change. Most of the time, though, the most popular compromise is to hyphenate your last name and the last name of your groom. For example, if your groom's name is John Smith and your name is Kate Jones. You would name yourself Kate Jones-Smith or Kate Smith-Jones. This allows you to keep going by your own last name while legally adopting your husband's last name at the same time.\"}, {\"letter\": \"E\", \"content\": \"The compromise is the biggest reason that so many women choose to hyphenate their last names. It is a way of you keeping your own identity while also making your future husband happy. It allows you to stay connected to accomplishments that you achieved before you got married. For example, many women who choose to hyphenate do so partially because they have earned higher educational degrees and certifications under their maiden names. They might have also had things published or publicized and want to stay connected to that identity. Hyphenating your last name can help you bridge the gap between your personal and professional lives. Many women who opt to simply keep their own names do so because they don't want to give up all that they have accomplished professionally. Adopting their husband's last name makes it hard for them to claim ownership of these accomplishments personally because they happened under their \\\"other\\\" name.\"}, {\"letter\": \"F\", \"content\": \"While tradition is one thing, there isn't any logical reason to completely change your name.

You've spent your whole life building your identity under a certain name. Obviously you will still be you even if you've taken on your husband's last name and omitted yours entirely.

Some men, regardless of how you might feel about some things, are traditionalists and feel that it is simply \\\"right\\\" for the woman to take the man's last name as her own.

After all, intelligent people earn more money, accumulate more wealth, and even live longer. But there's another side to the story. The brightest people and strongest leaders sometimes make errors others don't, especially in situations that require common sense.\\n\\nTravis Bradberry, president at TalentSmart, explained Bradberry in his post Why Smart People Act so Stupid that \\\"rational thinking and intelligence don't tend to go hand in hand\\\". Intelligent people are more prone to silly mistakes because of blind spots in how they use logic. These blind spots exist because smart people tend to be overconfident in their reasoning abilities. \\\"They're so used to being right and having quick answers that they don't even realise when they're making a mess by answering without thinking things through.\\\"\\n\\nA lifetime of praise leads smart people to develop too much faith in their intelligence and abilities. They often fail to recognise when they need help, and when they do recognise it, they tend to believe that no one else is capable of providing it.\\n\\n\\\"It's hard for anyone to graciously accept the fact that they're wrong. It's even harder for smart people because they grow so used to being right all the time that it becomes a part of their identity,\\\" Bradberry wrote. \\\"For smart people, being wrong can feel like a personal attack, and being right, a necessity.\\\"\\n\\nSmart people also have a hard time accepting feedback. They tend to undervalue the opinions of others, which means they have trouble believing that anyone is qualified to give them useful feedback. Not only does this tendency hinder their growth and performance, it can lead to harmful relationships, both personally and professionally.\\n\\nSmart people develop overachieving personalities because things come so easily to them. They simply don't understand how hard some people have to work to accomplish the same things, and because of that, they push people too hard. They set the bar too high, and when people take too long or don't get things quite right, they assume it's due to lack of effort.

But it isn't. Refugees who settle in other countries often find themselves unable to continue on their previous career path due to a new set of employer standards or skills requirements. To solve this problem, the U.S. State Department is posing a solution: online learning.\\n\\nThe State Department will announce a partnership with an online education platform called Coursera. The platform will allow refugees worldwide to take thousands of online courses for free. \\\"Coursera for Refugees\\\" will be available for any non-profit group that supports refugees in any country, as well as individual refugees. They can apply for fully funded access to Coursera's course catalog, which means they can take all of the platform's classes and obtain professional certificates for free.

For one, starting on a new career path is not as simple as watching a few videos and obtaining an online certificate; even those looking to continue previous careers can't simply rely on an online lecture to get them up-to-date on standards, policies, and practices. For another, most of the classes on Coursera are in English, and though there are plans to add translations, language barriers can be a big obstacle.
