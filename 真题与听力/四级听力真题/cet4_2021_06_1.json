            "correct_answer": "Technology has penetrated into every corner of modern society, ranging from manufacturing industry to family life. To some extent, people are becoming addicted to technology. First of all, modern people seem to live on technology products. We get connected with each other via Internet, shop online with mobile phones, and enjoy self-service on machines in banks and restaurants. However, many people tend to go to extremes. They rely so heavily on their cellphones that they feel unease once they are not having their cellphones around for more than five minutes. Another typical example is that with the appearance of various social video Apps like TikTok and Kuaishou, people can't resist the temptation of them. They are addicted to the virtual world and even forget to eat, work and communicate with family members or friends. Moreover, numerous studies claim that addiction to technology is real and it has the same effect on the brain as drug addiction. Therefore, it is advisable for modern people to reasonably reduce their addiction to technology while enjoying the convenience brought by it. Nothing should go overboard.",

          "passage": "Most animals seek shade when temperatures in the Sahara Desert soar to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. But for the Saharan silver ant, crawling from their underground nests into the sun's brutal rays to hunt for food, this is the perfect time to seek lunch. In 2015 these ants were joined in the desert by scientists from two Belgian universities, who spent a month in the extreme heat tracking the ants and digging out their nests. The goal was simple, to discover how the species adapted to the kind of heat that can literally melt the bottom of shoes.\n\nBack in Belgium, the scientists looked at the ants under an electronic microscope and found that their thick, triangular hair reflects light like a prism (棱镜), giving them a metallic reflection and protecting them from the sun's awful heat. When Ph.D. student Quentin Willot removed the hair from an ant with a tiny knife and put it under a heat lamp, its temperature jumped.\n\nThe ants' method of staying cool is unique among animals. Could this reflective type of hair protect people? Willot says companies are interested in adapting these ants' method of heat protection for human use, including everything from helping to protect the lives of firefighters to keeping homes cool in summer.",
