Still, the idea that exercising for just 10 minutes a week may be enough to increase your lifespan is novel. It's also somewhat _27_, since the federal physical activity guidelines recommend getting at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise or 150 minutes of _28_ exercise each week.\\n\\nThe study was based on data from more than 88,000 U.S. adults who _29_ in the National Health Interview Survey between 1997 and 2008.\\n\\nContrary to some research that has found an _30_ limit to the amount of exercise that is healthy, the researchers found that there was _31_ no limit to the longevity (长寿) benefits of exercise.

In other words, even if a certain food is still grown on some corner of the Earth, it doesn't mean that everyone will continue to have the same degree of access as today.\"}, {\"letter\": \"E\", \"content\": \"Overall, the yields of many foods, from staples to life-enhancing extras such as coffee and chocolate, will likely be impacted by climate change too. How those decreases will be felt will depend on the degree of warming and the crop in question, but in general, \\\"anything over about 30°C is very bad for crops,\\\" says Wolfram Schlenker, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University.

Other studies, including studies of wheat in India and corn in Africa, also found that there is a threshold above which yields sharply decline: crops can adapt and move, but only to a point. \\\"What's common to all studies is the finding that extreme heat is damaging to crop growth, although exact cutoffs vary by crop,\\\" Schlenker says. \\\"If predictions for the end of the century are true, though, I think a lot of agricultural areas in the US will see significant hits.\\\"\"}, {\"letter\": \"G\", \"content\": \"Under current conditions, about 4% of the world's croplands experience drought in any given year, but by the end of the century those conditions are forecasted to jump to about 18% per year.

Researcher Andrew Jarvis and his colleagues found that 80% of coffee-growing zones in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050, for example, while climate change will likely have \\\"great impacts\\\" on cocoa (可可粉) production in West Africa. \\\"High quality chocolate will be less available in the future, and if you want it, you'll have to pay a lot more for it,\\\" Jarvis says.\"}, {\"letter\": \"H\", \"content\": \"This means that, for those who can afford it, some foods will simply cost them more in the future.

While this can be good news for the world's poorest people who now consume more calories, protein and fat than in the past, homogeneity (同一性) and over-dependence on a handful of staples leaves us vulnerable to threats such as drought, disease and pests—all of which are predicted to worsen in many parts of the world as a result of climate change.\"}, {\"letter\": \"J\", \"content\": \"There are ways we could soften the coming blow to the global food supply, however.

Sometimes it's because I actually am busy, but other times it's because that's what I think I'm supposed to say. That's what important people say. That's what people who get promoted say. But working long hours doesn't drive better results. Never taking a vacation won't lead to a promotion. So why are we so proud to talk about how busy we are all the time?\\n\\nIn 2016, researchers from Columbia, Harvard, and Georgetown conducted a study to figure it out. They found busy people are perceived to be of high status, and interestingly, these status attributions are heavily influenced by our own beliefs about social mobility. In other words, the more we believe that one has the opportunity for success based on hard work, the more we tend to think that people who skip leisure and work all the time are of higher standing.\\n\\nThat's why we feel like we have to appear busy, and there's a real perception that if someone is knee-deep in meetings, emails, and stress, then they're probably a big deal. This culture of busyness is making it hard for employees to find work-life balance. According to a recent study, one in five highly engaged employees is at risk of burnout (精疲力竭).\\n\\nPersonally, I'm going to stop saying \\\"busy\\\" when people ask me how I am. It sounds self-righteous (自以为是的) and sets the wrong tone. Phrases like \\\"I have limited access to email\\\" and \\\"I'll respond as soon as I get back\\\" sound like you're being held against your will from working as opposed to making the most of your time off.\\n\\nThat's why we recently launched the Out of Office Email Generator, a free tool you can use before your next long weekend or trip. You can share loud and proud that you won't be checking email until you're back. Managers need to think twice about emailing their teams on the weekend and talking about how busy they are.

We found that women paid on average $18 less per ticket than their male colleagues. Further investigation allowed us to conclude that this gap is largely explained by the fact that women tended to book earlier than men, 1.8 days on average.\\n\\nWe wanted to determine what was causing these gender differences in booking business trips so we tested a variety of possible explanations, such as women choosing to plan ahead or male frequent travelers being inclined to book late. None of these explained away the gender gap, so we applied data collected from surveys that express consumer preferences that play a central role in economic decisions, such as patience and risk avoidance.\\n\\nWe found that only the concept of \\\"negative reciprocity\\\"—in which an employee who feels unfairly treated engages in negative behaviors, such as spending their company's money less carefully—explains these differences. The surveys showed men tend to exhibit more of these negative behaviors than women. This isn't to say that all men engage in these behaviors—or that booking relatively late is a sign of abnormal behavior. It only means that the gender gap disappears when we plug in the negative reciprocity variable.\\n\\nPrior research on negative reciprocity among workers found that it can result in lower employee motivation, business performance and workplace morale (士气) and culture.\\n\\nOur results show another way these negative behaviors can manifest themselves, like in airline bookings, and add to evidence that women are less likely to engage in them.\\n\\nCompanies spend significant sums of money on business travel. While that $18 difference per ticket may seem small, it adds up. Our analysis suggests early booking by women can translate into savings of $1 million a year for a large multinational company with 20,000 regular travelers.\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 51, \"content\": \"What did the author's team conclude about the gender difference in airfares from their further investigation?\", \"options\": [\"It is largely attributed to women booking earlier than men.\", \"It is largely explained by women's choosing cheaper flights.\", \"It is mainly accounted for by male employees' readiness to pay more.\", \"It is due to the fact that women care more about their company's money.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 52, \"content\": \"What did the researchers want to determine by testing a variety of possible explanations?\", \"options\": [\"What made male frequent travelers book air tickets late.\", \"What caused women to plan ahead in booking business trips.\", \"What motivated women to book cheaper flights.\", \"What accounted for the gender gap in airfares.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 53, \"content\": \"What happened when the negative reciprocity variable was taken into account?\", \"options\": [\"Both men and women were found to engage in negative behaviors.\", \"Neither men nor women viewed booking late as a bad behavior.\", \"The gender difference in airfare expenses no longer existed.\", \"The gender gap tended to narrow to a significant degree.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 54, \"content\": \"What did prior research on negative reciprocity among workers find?\", \"options\": [\"It can do more harm to the workplace than to employees.\", \"It contributes to the male-female divide in the workplace.\", \"It proves to be counterproductive in a number of ways.\", \"It can result in increasing labor-management conflicts.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 55, \"content\": \"What does the author emphasize about their analysis in the last paragraph?\", \"options\": [\"It can help companies increase their savings significantly.\", \"It can duly contribute to companies' business performance.\", \"It can translate women's booking practice into men's behavior.\", \"It can enhance large multinational companies' competitiveness.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}]}]}",
