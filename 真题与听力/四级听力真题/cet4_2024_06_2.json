Communicative abstraction, according to the researchers, reflects the tendency of people to use 'abstract speech that focuses on the broader picture and ______ purpose of action rather than concrete speech focusing on details and the means of ______ action.' Interestingly, they found that men were far more likely to speak in the abstract than were women.\\n\\nTo arrive at this ______, the researchers examined the linguistic (语言的) patterns of men and women in over 600,000 blog posts written on websites. To do this, the researchers computed abstractness ratings for ______ 29 ______ 40,000 commonly used words in the English language. Words considered to be concrete could be easily visualized such as 'table' or 'chair'. Words that were more ______ to visualize, for example, 'justice' or 'morality' were considered to be more abstract. They found that men used ______ more abstract language in their blog posts.\\n\\nWhat is the ______ of this effect? The researchers suggest that power differences between the genders — that is, men having more power in society — might be a key determinant (决定因素). For instance, in a follow-up study conducted with a sample of 300 students, the researchers ______ power dynamics in an interpersonal setting to see if this would influence communicative abstraction. They found that participants in a high-power interviewer role were more likely to give abstract descriptions of behaviors than were participants in a low-power interviewee role. This suggests that communicating more abstractly does not reflect a ______ tendency of men or women but rather ______ within specific contexts.\", \"word_bank\": {\"A\": \"approximately\", \"B\": \"attaining\", \"C\": \"conclusion\", \"D\": \"difficult\", \"E\": \"emerges\", \"F\": \"fixed\", \"G\": \"ignored\", \"H\": \"legally\", \"I\": \"manipulated\", \"J\": \"recommended\", \"K\": \"refraining\", \"L\": \"signals\", \"M\": \"significantly\", \"N\": \"source\", \"O\": \"ultimate\"}, \"blanks\": [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]}}, {\"subsection_name\": \"Section B\", \"directions\": \"In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.

As a result, the decisions we make for our present selves often look very different from our decisions for our future selves. We believe that tomorrow will be different.

While the two tactics (手段) above can be effective in making better long-term choices, in the end, you're still struggling against human nature. Our brains are hardwired for instant gratification. Instead of fighting your present self's need for immediate rewards, why not use it to your advantage? When most of us set goals, we focus on long-term results We want to see — e.g. losing weight, getting a promotion, retiring in comfort, etc. While those visions of our future selves can be inspiring, when it comes to actually doing the day-to-day work, it may be more effective to reframe activities in terms of their immediate, or at least very near-term rewards.\"}, {\"letter\": \"J\", \"content\": \"Take writing this article, for instance.

Is it habits, connections, luck, work ethic or any other behavior? I believe the key to success is willpower. Willpower is the ability to control yourself. It is a strong determination that allows you to do something difficult. It is a behavior we are born with more than one we learn. However, it is possible to not only learn it, but also strengthen it with constant exercise.\\n\\nWillpower is just like a muscle, to keep it strong you need to constantly exercise it. People with a great amount of willpower have the discipline to develop positive, successful habits. Even with an incredible amount of talent, without the discipline and motivation to create positive habits, it can be difficult to achieve success.\\n\\nWillpower and habits go hand in hand. It is critical to create good habits and take the actions necessary to stick to those habits day in and day out for greater success. Almost half of our daily actions are part of our habits and not decisions, so once the correct habits are in place, you will automatically perform those tasks on a day-to-day basis.\\n\\nThe best way to create and stick to a habit is to have strong motivation. It's easier to change your habits to lose weight if you have a health issue and you want to be around longer for your kids, or if your business is something you're passionate about. Having a valuable outcome associated with a habit will help you stick to that habit permanently.\\n\\nThe art of self-control is one that most successful individuals have mastered. Self-control enables you to avoid behaviors that don't contribute to your success and adopt those that do.\\n\\nBecause there is a delayed satisfaction associated with self-control, it can be easy to get off track. However, if you work on sticking to those small positive habits one day at a time, it becomes easier to stay strong and achieve that delayed reward. Once a reward is achieved, it is much easier to continue sticking to your habits.\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 46, \"content\": \"What does the author say we need to do to strengthen our willpower?\", \"options\": [\"Keep it under control.\", \"Apply it continuously.\", \"Learn from entrepreneurs.\", \"Aim at success determinedly.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 47, \"content\": \"How are almost half of our daily actions performed according to the passage?\", \"options\": [\"Out of habit.\", \"With determination.\", \"Like muscle building.\", \"By self-discipline\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 48, \"content\": \"What will help people stick to doing something constructive automatically?\", \"options\": [\"Practising it on a day-to-day basis.\", \"Associating it with improving health.\", \"Possessing a reasonable amount of talent.\", \"Foreseeing the desired outcome it will yield.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 49, \"content\": \"How does the art of self-control help us succeed?\", \"options\": [\"By allowing us to remain clear-headed permanently.\", \"By enabling us to alter our behaviors constantly.\", \"By enabling us to take positive actions.\", \"By allowing us to avoid taking risks.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 50, \"content\": \"Why can it be difficult for us to maintain self-control?\", \"options\": [\"Most of us are not in the habit of exercising self-control.\", \"We may not get immediate rewards from self-control.\", \"Self-control tends to be associated with pains.\", \"Self-control only brings about small benefits.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}, {\"title\": \"Passage Two\", \"content\": \"Today, most scientific research is funded by government grants, companies doing research and development and nonprofit foundations. As a society, we reap the rewards from this science but we also help pay for it. You indirectly support science through taxes you pay, products and services you purchase, and donations you make.\\n\\nFunding for science has changed with the times. Historically, science has been largely supported through private patronage (资助), church sponsorship or simply paying for the research yourself. Today, researchers are likely to be funded by a mix of grants from various government agencies, institutions, and foundations. Other research is funded by private companies. Such corporate sponsorship is widespread in some fields. Almost 75% of U.S. clinical trials in medicine are paid for by private companies. And, of course, some researchers today still fund small-scale studies out of their own pockets. Most of us can't afford to do nuclear research as a private hobby, but bird watchers, rock collectors, and others can do real research on a limited budget.\\n\\nIn a perfect world, money wouldn't matter — all scientific studies would be completely objective. But in the real world, funding may introduce biases. Drug research sponsored by the pharmaceutical (制药的) industry is more likely to end up favoring the drug under consideration than studies sponsored by government grants or charitable organizations. Similarly, nutrition research sponsored by the food industry is more likely to end up favoring the food under consideration than independently funded research.\\n\\nSo what should we make of all this? Should we ignore any research funded by companies or special interest groups? Certainly not. These groups provide invaluable funding for scientific research. Furthermore, science has many safeguards in place to catch instances of bias that affect research outcomes. Ultimately, misleading results will be corrected as science proceeds, however, this process takes time. Meanwhile, it pays to examine studies funded by industry or special interest groups with extra care. Are the results consistent with other independently funded studies?
