Numerous writers produce masterpieces well into their 70s and beyond. Such ___27___ accomplishments highlight an important point. Our capacity to speak, write and learn new vocabulary does not seem to ___28___ with age. Our eyesight may dim and our recall may weaken, but by comparison, our ability to produce and to ___29___ language is well preserved into older adulthood.\\n\\nIndeed, the latest research that has emerged on language and aging shows that language mastery is a ___30___ that we begin as infants and continue on for the rest of our lives. Some aspects of our language abilities, such as our knowledge of word meanings, ___31___ improve during middle and late adulthood. One study, for example, found that adults over sixty had an average vocabulary size of over 21,000 words. The researchers also studied a ___32___ of college students and found that their average vocabulary contained ___33___ 16,000 words. In another study, older adults, with an average age of 75, ___34___ better than participants in their youth or middle years on tasks that required them to determine the meaning of words. Thus, language seems to be a skill that, contrary to what many might ___35___ , does not weaken with age.\", \"word_bank\": {\"A\": \"actually\", \"B\": \"approximately\", \"C\": \"assume\", \"D\": \"component\", \"E\": \"comprehend\", \"F\": \"deteriorate\", \"G\": \"equivalent\", \"H\": \"journey\", \"I\": \"literary\", \"J\": \"performed\", \"K\": \"rarely\", \"L\": \"sample\", \"M\": \"undermined\", \"N\": \"unique\", \"O\": \"unit\"}, \"blanks\": [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]}}, {\"subsection_name\": \"Section B\", \"directions\": \"In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.

Some researchers are now encouraging us to stop thinking about work-life balance as an achievement that you either hit or don't.

Researchers Ioana Lupu and Mayra Ruiz-Castro argue that work-life balance is \\\"a cycle, not an achievement\\\" In their 2020 study, the researchers interviewed nearly 80 employees at two London-based firms—an equal number of men and women between the ages of 30 and 50, all with at least one dependent child—who worked in middle or senior management roles.\"}, {\"letter\": \"D\", \"content\": \"Although it sounds like the respondents had a lot in common, here's what separated them: about 30% of the men and 50% of the Women reported resisting working long hours.

Did they feel angry, sad, energised? Third, they reprioritised, asking \\\"Is working long hours really worth cutting back on family time?\\\", for example.

Unsurprisingly, Kelly and Moen found that employees in the redesign group reported less stress and less burnout. They were less likely to quit their jobs; indeed, over the next four years, they were 40% less likely to quit than those who kept working under the old policies.\"}, {\"letter\": \"K\", \"content\": \"\\\"Work-life balance is understood to be an individual's response, so people think 'it's up to me to manage the craziness of my work life'\\\", says Kelly.

A tipping point was reached in 2020 when human-made materials — such as steel, concrete and plastic — were found to weigh more than all life on Earth. Continuing to grow concrete forests rather than real ones is shortsighted. Simply being in the nearest wood has such health benefits that the Woodland Trust successfully lobbied for it to be prescribed by doctors.\\n\\nYet slipping from popular culture is the wonder and beauty of the natural world. For every three nature-related words in hit songs of the 1950s, researchers found, there was only slightly more than one 50 years later. It is not a moment too soon that teenagers will be able to take a natural history test given that for decades children have been able to name more video game characters than wildlife species.\\n\\nPart of remedying this social disease would be for parliament to pass a \\\"right to grow\\\" law, allowing anyone to turn underused public spaces into vegetable and fruit gardens. The idea is for people to get back in touch with the soil — while producing food sustainably.\\n\\nVegetable planting has a respectable tradition. In April 1649, locals responded to high prices and food shortages by cultivating vegetables on common land in Southern England. The practice of throwing seed bombs to turn vacant plots of land green took off in 1970s New York, and has been revived by green-thumbed social media influencers who defy local US regulations in a war on ugly spots in cities.\\n\\nApart from the urgent task of providing more healthy nutrients to those who increasingly can't afford them. Publicly accessible fruit and vegetable gardens connect what we eat to where it comes from—the means of production, if you will.
