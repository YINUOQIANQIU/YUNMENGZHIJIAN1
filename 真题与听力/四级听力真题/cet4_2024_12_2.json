And while bottles may be recyclable, very few are made of recycled plastic. One water bottle company launched recycled half-litre \\\"eco\\\" bottles alongside its standard bottles. Another has pledged to use only recycled plastic across its range by 2025. Chetan-Walsh believes in a ban on single-use bottles. Bans do exist in some places.

I felt that L was sailing the financial seas with no skills and no life jacket!\\nHowever, after talking to my friends who felt the same, I quickly realised that it wasn't my ignorance but the lack of financial education in our schooling system that is leaving high schoolers seriously behind in the modern world of money.\\nLet's compare a theoretical financial education subject to the standard compulsory English class. On average, English may not be the most popular subject, but it's consistently on the schedule throughout high school, with all students graduating fluent in English.\\nA financial education subject should do just the same. It shouldn't be just a one-day event but a course integrated throughout the whole of high school that would allow students to gradually expand their financial literacy, and would prevent the need for a 'catch up' phase once we're out on our own after graduation.\\nIn the same way that learning a language or new skills takes time, building financial skills requires practice and years to gradually accumulate bits and pieces of knowledge.\\nGiving young people the opportunity to become familiar with the world of money would provide them with a great advantage to enter adulthood with confidence and security so that they are able to manage their own money and look after themselves.\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 46, \"content\": \"What has the author come to realise since entering university?\", \"options\": [\"He needs a crash course on financial terms.\", \"He is very much lacking in financial literacy.\", \"It requires consistent education to be financially independent.\", \"It is unrealistic to give all Australian youth a financial education.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 47, \"content\": \"How did the author feel in today's money world?\", \"options\": [\"Badly equipped to survive.\", \"Ignorant of financial literature.\", \"Barely capable of moving ahead.\", \"Overwhelmed by the resources online.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 48, \"content\": \"What did the author realise after talking to his friends?\", \"options\": [\"They were as keen as he was on financial matters.\", \"The schooling system was to blame for his trouble.\", \"High schoolers knew nothing about the modern financial world.\", \"Financial courses were as unpopular as compulsory English classes.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 49, \"content\": \"What is the author's idea of a financial education course?\", \"options\": [\"It should foresee students' needs after graduation.\", \"It should provide students with some basic knowledge.\", \"It should be taught the same way as English is taught.\", \"It should be integrated into high school education.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 50, \"content\": \"What would financial literacy do to young people?\", \"options\": [\"Allow them to enter adulthood with financial security.\", \"Enable them to look after themselves without worrying about money.\", \"Render them confident and secure in terms of money management.\", \"Help them become familiar with the world of money.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}, {\"title\": \"Passage Two\", \"content\": \"Chocolates save us from many things, especially emotional distress.

But hey, we have some happy news for you. Scientists can still help save chocolates from dying out! If you are not aware as to why scientists made the statement about the death of this wonderful thing, let us tell you the facts. Chocolate trees, whose seeds are used to make chocolate, grow in the tropical plant world and require very specific weather conditions to prosper.\\n\\nNow, fifty percent of the world's cocoa (可可) beans come from two countries in West Africa: Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Scientists believe that both of these countries will experience a 3.8F temperature increase by 2050 due to global warming, endangering the cacao (可可树) farms in the rainforests. These farms will then have to be shifted to cooler mountainous areas, which are the natural habitat of wildlife. This will lead to some tough decisions: whether to grow chocolate or save wildlife.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the crisis of global warming has already had a serious negative impact on cacao farms' yields, leading to the prices of chocolates skyrocketing.\\n\\nScientists, however, are trying to find a long-term and eco-friendly solution to this problem! They are trying to modify the species with a gene-editing technology, which will transform the seedlings into a species that survives even in a drier and warmer climate.\\n\\nAccording to a report by The Business Insider, in the University of California's new bio-sciences building, tiny green cacao seedlings are lined up in refrigerated greenhouses for a new experiment by using a technology called CRISPR. By manipulating the DNA of plants, this technology is already being used across the world to make plants tougher and cheaper.
