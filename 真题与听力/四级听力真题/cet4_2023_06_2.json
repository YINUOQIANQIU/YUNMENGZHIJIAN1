For more than a decade, they have been under attack from e-commerce giants, blamed for making Americans fat, and accused of contributing to climate change.\\n\\nSupermarkets can technically be defined as giants housing 15,000 to 60,000 different products. The revolutionary idea of a self-service grocery, where people could hunt and gather food from aisles rather than asking a clerk to fetch items from behind a counter, first came about in America. There is some debate about which was the very first, but over the years a consensus has built around King Kullen Supermarket, founded in New York in 1930.\\n\\nFor some 300 years, Americans had fed themselves from small stores and public markets. Shopping for food involved mud, noisy chickens, clouds of flies, nasty smells, bargaining, and getting short-changed. The supermarket imitated the Fordist factory, with its emphasis on efficiency and standardization, and reimagined it as a place to buy food. Supermarkets may not feel cutting-edge now, but they were a revolution in distribution at the time. They were such strange marvels that, on her first official state visit to the United States in 1957, Queen Elizabeth II insisted on an impromptu (即兴的) tour of a suburban-Maryland Giant Food.\\n\\nThe typical supermarket layout has barely changed over the past 90 years. Most stores open with flowers, fruit and vegetables at the front as a breath of freshness to arouse our appetite. Meanwhile, they keep the milk, eggs, and other daily basics all the way back so you'll travel through as much of the store as possible, and be tempted along the way.\\n\\nIn the early days, as the supermarket multiplied, so did our suspicion of it. We have long feared that this \\\"revolution in distribution\\\" uses corporate black magic on our appetite. The book The Hidden Persuaders, published in 1957, warned that supermarkets were putting women in a \\\"hypnoidal trance (催眠恍惚状态),\\\" causing them to wander aisles bumping into boxes and \\\"picking things off shelves at random.\\\"\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 46, \"content\": \"What problem have supermarkets been facing?\", \"options\": [\"They are actually on the way to bankruptcy.\", \"They have been losing customers and profits.\", \"They are forced to use e-commerce strategies.\", \"They have difficulty adapting to climate change.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 47, \"content\": \"What does the passage say about the idea of a self-service grocery?\", \"options\": [\"It was put forward by King Kullen.\", \"It originated in the United States.\", \"It has been under constant debate.\", \"It proves revolutionary even today.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 48, \"content\": \"What did supermarkets do by adopting the Fordist factory approach?\", \"options\": [\"They modernized traditional groceries in many ways.\", \"They introduced cutting-edge layout of their stores.\", \"They improved the quality of the food they sold.\", \"They made food shopping more efficient and standardized.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 49, \"content\": \"What is the typical supermarket layout intended to do?\", \"options\": [\"Arouse customers' appetite to buy flowers, fruit and vegetables.\", \"Provide customers easy access to items they want to buy.\", \"Induce customers to make more unplanned purchases.\", \"Enable customers to have a more enjoyable shopping experience.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 50, \"content\": \"What have people long feared about supermarkets?\", \"options\": [\"They use tricky strategies to promote their business.\", \"They are going to replace the local groceries entirely.\", \"They apply corporate black magic to the goods on display.\", \"They take advantage of the weaknesses of women shoppers.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}, {\"title\": \"Passage Two\", \"content\": \"The traditional school year, with three months of vacation every summer, was first implemented when America was an agricultural society and the summer months were needed for farm work. Since then, we've completely changed as a nation. Students no longer spend summers farming, but they aren't in school, either. The average American student receives 13 weeks off from school each calendar year-with about 11 of those during the summer. Few other countries have more than seven weeks off in a school calendar.\\n\\nWith the U.S. lagging behind other countries in academics, it's time to consider year-round schooling. One benefit of this change is that students will not fall victim to the \\\"summer slide,\\\" or the well-documented phenomenon where students forget some of the knowledge they have acquired when too much time is taken off from school. Decades of research shows that it can take from 8 to 13 weeks at the beginning of every school year for students to get back to where they were before the summer holiday.\\n\\nBut year-round schooling isn't just about academics. Teachers and students experience a closer relationship in year-round schools than they do in traditional schools and, in the absence of any long-term break, students do not feel detached from the school environment. These closer bonds and greater attachment pay off. Research shows that students in year-round schools are more self-confident and feel more positive about their schooling experience.\\n\\nBut don't kids need time to relax? Some childhood development experts believe that time off from school is vital to healthy development as kids are not designed to spend so much of their time inside classrooms and the summer break provides a perfect opportunity to get outside. The problem with this argument is that most children aren't playing outside or even spending time with other kids. While some children visit summer camps, most stay at home, watching TV or playing games on electronic devices, which hardly benefits them.\\n\\nThe U.S. has changed from a farming economy to a knowledge- and innovation-based economy, so it makes sense for the school year to change as well.\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 51, \"content\": \"Why did America's traditional school year have a three-month summer vacation?\", \"options\": [\"Students needed to help with farm work.\", \"Students needed time to learn necessary farming skills.\", \"The agricultural society then attached less importance to academics.\", \"America lagged behind other countries in making a scientific school calendar.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 52, \"content\": \"What benefit will year-round schooling bring students in addition to improving their learning?\", \"options\": [\"It will help them get back to where their lessons started.\", \"It will enable them to absorb what they have learned.\", \"It will familiarize them with the school environment.\", \"It will strengthen their relationship with teachers.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 53, \"content\": \"What do some childhood development experts believe about the long summer vacation?\", \"options\": [\"It meets students' need to study on their own.\", \"It enables students to learn about the outside world.\", \"It satisfies students' desire to stay longer at home.\", \"It contributes to students' healthy growth.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 54, \"content\": \"What is the argument against the experts' idea of a long summer vacation?\", \"options\": [\"It does little good to most students.\", \"It benefits few students playing outside.\", \"It leads students to neglect their studies.\", \"It makes students addicted to computer games.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 55, \"content\": \"What does the author think of the traditional school year in the U.S. today?\", \"options\": [\"Well-grounded.\", \"Culture-bound.\", \"Outdated.\", \"Welcomed.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}]}]}",
