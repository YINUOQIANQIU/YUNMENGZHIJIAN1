Three days later, you're overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even though we were the ones who said 'yes' to them in the first place. Even worse, people will occasionally fight to do things that waste time. You don't have to do something just because it exists. It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple 'no' will be more productive than whatever work the most efficient person can cope with. But if the benefits of saying 'no' are so obvious, then why do we say 'yes' so often?\"}, {\"letter\": \"C\", \"content\": \"We say 'yes' to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don't want to be seen as rude or unhelpful. Often, we have to consider saying 'no' to someone we will interact with again in the future—our co-worker, our spouse, our family and friends. Saying 'no' to our superiors at work can be particularly difficult. In these situations, I like the approach recommended in Essentialism by Greg McKeown. He writes, 'Remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said 'yes' and force them to deal with the trade-off. For example, if your manager comes to you and asks you to do X, you can respond with 'Yes, I'm happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?'\"}, {\"letter\": \"D\", \"content\": \"Collaborating with others is an important element of life. The thought of straining the relationship outweighs the commitment of our time and energy. For this reason, it can be helpful to be gracious in your response. Do whatever favors you can, and be warm-hearted and direct when you have to say no. But even after we have accounted for these social considerations, many of us still seem to do a poor job of managing the trade-off between yes and no. We find ourselves over-committed to things that don't meaningfully improve or support those around us, and certainly don't improve our own lives.\"}, {\"letter\": \"E\", \"content\": \"Perhaps one issue is how we think about the meaning of yes and no. The words 'yes' and 'no' get so often used in comparison with each other that it feels like they carry equal weight in conversation. In reality, they're not just opposite in meaning, but of entirely different magnitudes in commitment. When you say 'no', you're only saying 'no' to one option. When you say 'yes', you're saying 'no' to every other option. I like how economist Tim Harford put it, 'Every time we say 'yes' to a request, we're also saying 'no' to anything else we might accomplish with the time.' Once you're committed to something, you've already decided how that future block of time will be spent. In other words, saying 'no' saves you time in the future. Saying 'yes' costs you time in the future. 'No' is a form of time credit. You retain the ability to spend your future time however you want. 'Yes' is a form of time debt. You have to pay back your commitment at some point.\"}, {\"letter\": \"F\", \"content\": \"'No' is a decision. 'Yes' is a responsibility. Saying 'no' is sometimes seen as a luxury that only those in power can afford. And it's true: turning down opportunities is easier when you can fall back on the safety net provided by power, money, and authority. But it's also true that saying 'no' is not merely a privilege reserved for the successful. It's also a strategy that can help you become successful. Saying 'no' is an important skill to develop at any stage of your career because it retains the most important asset in life; your time. As investor Pedro Sorrentino put it, 'If you don't guard your time, people will steal it from you.' You need to say 'no' to whatever isn't leading you toward your goals.\"}, {\"letter\": \"G\", \"content\": \"Nobody embodied this idea better than Steve Jobs, who said, 'People think focus means saying 'yes' to the thing you've got to focus on.

At around 20 kilograms per person global fish consumption is now more than twice what it was in the 1960s. What's really remarkable, though, is where that fish comes from.\\n\\nFor the first time in human history, most of our aquatic food now comes from farming rather than fishing.\\n\\nPeople ate around 73 million tonnes of farmed fish—just more than half of the volume of fish that humans consumed—in 2014. That's out of a total fish supply of 167 million tonnes; the remaining 20 million or so tonnes go into things like animal feed and medical products.\\n\\nTo keep eating fish at the current rate, we're definitely going to need to keep aquaculture developing. That's because the volume of fish caught in the wild has leveled off since the 1990s.\\n\\nBack in 1974, only 10% of marine fish stocks had been overfished. Now, more than three-tenths are. Only a tenth of our oceans' fish stocks could sustain heavier fishing than current levels.\\n\\nBut while catchings at sea have suffered, fish-farming has been growing at a fast rate. A lot of that is coming from China, which produces 60% of the world's farmed fish. In fact, some 35 countries, including China, now produce more farmed than wild-caught fish.\\n\\nThis shift toward aquaculture isn't just good for ensuring salmon on your plate; it's also crucial to ensuring food security and sustainability. By 2050, the world will need to feed an estimated 9.7 billion people. They'll have to get their protein somewhere. However, raising cattle, pigs, and other land-based animals requires vast sums of grain and water. For example, pound for pound, beef requires 15 times more feed to raise than carp, a freshwater fish farmed all over Asia. That grain—and the water needed to grow it—could be consumed by people instead.\\n\\nHowever, aquaculture is no silver bullet. In some southeast Asian countries, shrimp farming does disastrous damage to marine ecosystems. Despite these problems, however, shrimp continues to be among the most popular seafood worldwide.\", \"questions\": [{\"number\": 46, \"content\": \"What does the author say is remarkable about the fish we eat?\", \"options\": [\"They reproduce quickly.\", \"They are mostly farmed.\", \"They have become as important as grain.\", \"They have a longer history than humans.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 47, \"content\": \"What do we need to do if we keep consuming fish at the current rate?\", \"options\": [\"Increase the fishing volume considerably.\", \"Develop more advanced fishing technology.\", \"Enlarge the marine fish stocks effectively.\", \"Expand the scale of fish-farming continuously.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 48, \"content\": \"What does the author say about China in terms of aquatic food?\", \"options\": [\"It places increasing emphasis on fishing now.\", \"It boasts of the world's largest fishing stocks.\", \"It raises more fish than caught from the wild.\", \"It supplies 60% of the world's fish products.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 49, \"content\": \"Why does the author say aquaculture is so important these days?\", \"options\": [\"It is a must for feeding the world's fast-growing population.\", \"It proves a reliable source of protein for humans and animals.\", \"It is essential to maintaining both mental and physical health.\", \"It ensures a balanced healthy diet for people the world over.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}, {\"number\": 50, \"content\": \"What does the author imply by saying aquaculture is no silver bullet?\", \"options\": [\"Shrimp-farming is a risky business.\", \"Fish-farming will not be sustainable.\", \"Fish-farming may cause serious problems too.\", \"Shrimp-farming can become quite expensive.\"], \"correct_answer\": \"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}]}, {\"title\": \"Passage Two\", \"content\": \"In 2020, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP).\\n\\nWhy a Nobel Prize for the WFP, and why now? In 2019, the WFP assisted nearly 100 million people in 88 countries. It is the safety net for those who fall off the edge of existence. It is a response to solving the problem of food instability. Its Nobel Prize reminds us all of the moral hazard in imagining that the poor and vulnerable are somebody else's problem.\\n\\nThe WFP has been around since 1961 and has been the global coordinator of nationally based efforts to avoid disasters with food aid. Despite decades of effort to eliminate hunger, the latest estimate is that about 11% of people on the planet (about 820 million people) are suffering daily undernourishment. Progress at reducing undernourishment has stopped despite gains through the 1990s and 2000s.\\n\\nDeveloped countries sometimes offer food and aid to developing ones, but at a price. One American philosopher stated that addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable is about more than money—it is mostly about creating conditions under which prosperity and opportunity can thrive. When aid is offered with heavy conditions attached, like loan repayment or food for resources, it often widens the gap between rich and poor and sustains the old world order. This is why the work of the WFP is so vital.\\n\\nThe scientific community, however, can provide a helping hand to the WFP. By sharing knowledge of agriculture and climate with peers in countries most vulnerable to poverty and hunger, scientists can help reduce these problems. By making its voice heard, science can lead by example. The ability to overcome food shortages that must be built into some of the poorest countries will not come from loans from wealthy countries, which may have food problems of their own, or world economic institutions.
