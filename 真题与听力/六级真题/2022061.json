      "passage_content": "A. Fazila is a young woman that has been dealing with eczema, a common skin condition, for the past five years, but never got it treated. The nearest hospital is an hour away, by boat and bus, and her skin condition didn't seem serious enough to make the trek, so she ignored it—until a new technology brought the doctor to her. Fazila lives on one of the remote river islands in northern Bangladesh. These islands are low-lying, temporary sand islands that are continuously formed and destroyed through sand buildup and erosion. They are home to over six million people, who face repeated displacement from flooding and erosion—which may be getting worse because of climate change-and a range of health risks, including poor nutrition, malaria and other water-borne diseases.\n\nB. The most dangerous thing for these remote island dwellers is land erosion. The second is lack of access to medical supplies and doctors. There are no doctors within miles, and while child mortality and maternal death have gone down in the rest of the country, this is not the case for the islands. The medical situation is so bad that it really takes away from the quality of their life. Yet for many island inhabitants—some of Bangladesh's poorest—paying for health care is a costly ordeal. Victims of erosion lose their houses, agricultural land and jobs as farmers, fishermen and day laborers. Though government hospitals are free, many people hesitate to go, citing long commutes, endless lines and questionable diagnoses. For convenience's sake, one-third of rural households visit unqualified village doctors, who rely on unscientific methods of treatment, according to a 2016 study in the peer reviewed journal Global Health Action.\n\nC. On the islands, there's even a colloquial expression for the idea of making medical care your lowest priority: It's known as \"rog pushai rakha\" in Bengali, which roughly translates to \"stockpiling their diseases\"—waiting to seek medical attention until a condition becomes extremely serious. Now, a new virtual medical service called Teledaktar (TD) is trying to make health care more easily accessible. Every week, TD's medical operators travel to the islands by boat, carrying a laptop, a portable printer for prescriptions and tools to run basic medical screenings such as blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature and weight. They choose an area of the island with the best Internet reception and set up a makeshift medical center which consists of plastic stools and small tables borrowed from the locals' homes, a tent in case of rain and a sheet that is strung up to give the patients privacy during their session.\n\nD. Launched in October 2018, TD has eight centers in towns and villages across rural Bangladesh and on three islands. It is funded by a nonprofit organization founded by Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, finance and technology professionals. Inside the center, the laptop screen lights up to reveal Dr. Tina Mustahid TD's head physician, live-streamed from the capital city of Dhaka for free remote medical consultations. Affectionately called Doctor Apa—\"older sister\" in Bengali—by her patients, she is one of three volunteer doctors at TD.\n\nE. \"I diagnose them through conversation,\" says Dr. Mustahid. \"Sometimes it's really obvious things that local doctors don't have the patience to talk through with their patients. For example, a common complaint mothers come in with is that their children refuse to eat their meals. The mothers are concerned they are dealing with indigestion, but it's because they are feeding the children packaged chips which are cheap and convenient. I tell them it is ruining their appetite and ask them to cut back on unhealthy snacks\" Dr. Mustahid says building awareness about health and nutrition is important for island patients who are cut off from mainland resources.\n\nF. Even off the islands, Bangladesh faces a critical deficit of health services. The country has half the doctors-per-person ratio recommended by the World Health Organization: roughly one doctor per 2,000 people, instead of one doctor per 1,000 people. And of those physicians, many are concentrated in cities: 70% of the country's population live in rural areas, yet less than 20% of health workers practice there. Over 70% of TD's 3,000 patients are female, in part because many are not comfortable speaking with local doctors who tend to be male. The rural women are mostly not literate or confident enough to travel on their own to the nearest town to visit medical facilities. Many have spent their entire lives rebuilding their homes when the islands flood. Early marriage and young motherhood, which are prevalent in these parts of Bangladesh, also contribute to the early onset of health problems.\n\nG. For most TD patients on the islands, Dr. Mustahid is the first big city doctor that they've ever consulted. TD doctors are not meant to treat serious illnesses or conditions that require a doctor to be physically present, such as pregnancy. But they can write prescriptions, diagnose common ailments—including digestive issues, joint pain, skin diseases, fever and the common cold—and refer patients to doctors at local hospitals. The visit is also an opportunity for the patients, especially women, to air their concerns about aging, motherhood and reproductive health according to Dr. Mustahid. The doctors also offer health, dietary and lifestyle advice where necessary, including insight on everything from recognizing postnatal depression to daily exercise. Dr. Mustahid regularly recommends her patients to take a daily thirty-minute morning walk before the sun gets too intense.\n\nH. After a few sessions about general health issues Fazila finally opened up about something else that was bothering her: her persistent skin condition. It can get expensive to travel to the doctor, so usually the women living on the islands describe their illness to their husbands. The husbands then go to the pharmacy, try to describe the issue and return home with some random medicines. Nothing worked for Fazila until she started seeing Dr. Apa.\n\nI. Other nonprofits are also starting to provide health services on the islands. A local non-governmental organization called Friendship operates floating boat hospitals that provide health services to islands all over Bangladesh, docking at each for two months at a time. Friendship also runs satellite clinics in which one doctor and one clinic aide who are residents of the community disperse health and hygiene information.\n\nJ. TD still has a few major challenges. Many residents complain the medicines they are prescribed are sometimes unaffordable, but the government isn't doing enough for them. Patients often ask why the medicine isn't free along with the consultation from the doctors. The organizations are linked to local pharmacies and offer discounts to the patients and make sure to prescribe the most cost-effective brands, but still many residents can't afford even that.\n\nK. Nevertheless, TD's remote consultations seem to be popular: Of 3,000 patients, at least 200 have returned for follow-ups, according to TD. The reason, explains one resident, might be the simple gesture of treating the island inhabitants with respect. \"Dr. Apa is patient,\" he says, \"At government hospitals, the doctors treat us very badly, but here they listen to us, I can repeat myself many times and no one gets annoyed.\"",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nSelective colleges and universities in the U.S. are under fire for being too elite and too expensive, and for not training graduates for the world of work. Such charges ignore the fact that these institutions continue to prepare students for success in their work, for thoughtful engagement in civic life, for lifelong learning, and for understanding the world and those with whom they live.\n\nThese colleges and universities must be doing something right. Applications are at record highs, and their financial aid programs make them more accessible than ever. This model of education has long played a central role in creating opportunity, driving economic growth, and spurring innovation.\n\nYet, there is growing skepticism about the value of this model. The recent tax reform bill is a wake-up call that our strongest colleges and universities are under assault by some in government. The initial proposals would have made education unaffordable for many by taxing tuition waivers for graduate students and ending deductions for student loan interest. Thankfully, these provisions were ultimately stripped from the bill, but lawmakers let stand a new tax on the investment income of some colleges and universities.\n\nWhile these attacks are motivated by misguided ideas, we need to do a better job of explaining why these claims are false and why what we do is valuable. We cannot take for granted that any of this is obvious.\n\nIt is often said that elite colleges and universities do not train students, particularly those who study the liberal arts, for the workforce. But this can be refuted by scholarly research. The data are clear: a liberal arts education is great career preparation, both for excellent lifetime earnings and for satisfaction with the work. This education develops the skills of critical thinking, rigorous analysis of data and facts, communication with the written and spoken word, understanding of cultural differences and issues, and the ability to keep learning. In fact, liberal arts graduates do extremely well in every imaginable field.\n\nAccess to an education at selective colleges and universities is now more available than ever to low-and middle-income families. We have built endowments from donations by alumni and parents who understand and appreciate our mission to provide access and opportunity, and a significant portion of the returns from these endowments is used to fund financial aid.\n\nIronically, the new tax on endowments drains financial aid funds from the very schools most able to offer opportunity to those who have earned a spot but cannot otherwise afford this education. Beyond the virtue of access to those who have earned a place at these schools, the diversity of economic backgrounds enhances the education and experience of all of our students.\n\nPassage Two\n\nWhen a group of Australians was asked why they believed climate change was not happening, about 36% said it was \"common sense\", according to a report published last year by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. This was the most popular reason for their opinion, with only 11% saying their belief that climate change was not happening was based on scientific research.\n\nBut what do we mean by an appeal to common sense? Presumably it's an appeal to rationality of some sort that forms the basis of more complex reasoning. The appeal to common sense, however, is usually nothing more than an appeal to thinking that just feels right, but what feels right to one person may not feel right to another. Whether it feels right is usually a reflection of the world view and ideologies we have internalized, and that frames how we interact with new ideas. When new ideas are in accord with what we already believe, they are more readily accepted. When they are not, they, and the arguments that lead to them, are more readily rejected.\n\nWe often mistake this automatic compatibility testing of new ideas with existing beliefs as an application of common sense, but, in reality, it is more about judging than thinking. As Nobelist Daniel Kahneman notes in Thinking, Fast and Slow, when we arrive at conclusions in this way, the outcomes also feel true, regardless of whether they are. We are not psychologically well equipped to judge our own thinking.\n\nWe are also highly susceptible to a range of cognitive biases such as giving preference to the first things that come to mind when making decisions or giving weight to evidence.\n\nOne way we can check our internal biases and inconsistencies is through the social verification of knowledge, in which we test our ideas in a rigorous and systematic way to see if they make sense not just to us, but to other people. The outstanding example of this socially shared cognition is science.\n\nThat does not mean that individuals are not capable of excellent thinking, nor does it mean no individual is rational. But the extent to which individuals can do this on their own is a function of how well integrated they are with communities of systematic inquiry in the first place. You can't learn to think well by yourself.\n\nIn matters of science at least, those who value their common sense over methodological, collaborative investigation imagine themselves to be more free in their thinking, unbound by involvement with the group, but in reality they are tightly bound by their capabilities and perspectives. We are smarter together than we are individually, and perhaps that's just common sense.",
