Only by taking part in real-life activities, can we experience true happiness.\nIt cannot be denied that technology has certainly revolutionized interpersonal communication, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive. We must acknowledge that excessive dependence on the virtual world of networking alienates our connection with our families and friends as well as weakens our communicative ability. Over time, people tend to feel empty. Instead, when we begin to cherish everything around us in the real world and have a face-to-face talk with our families and friends, we will not feel alone anymore but achieve inner peace. For example, we can put down the phone, meet friends to exercise together, and go home to have dinner with our families.\nAs far as I'm concerned, our contact with real human beings can never be replaced by any interaction in the virtual world. Therefore, it is high time that we put away our phones and participated in real social life.",

      "correct_answer": "Since ancient times, the seal has been proof of identity and a symbol of power in China. The seal is not only practical, but also an art form and an ancient art that combines calligraphy and sculpture. It is often seen as an independent work of art alongside calligraphy and painting. The seal is extremely rich in aesthetic expression, from the selection of materials, the craftsmanship to the design of the typeface. Artists in other countries usually sign their paintings, while Chinese artists often use seals instead of signatures on their paintings and calligraphy. In this way, the seal also becomes an integral part of the work and is a way to reflect its uniqueness.",

      "correct_answer": "The Importance of Mutual Trust and Openness in Promoting Cooperation\nIt is now widely accepted that mutual trust and openness is the key to promoting cooperation. As for me, I totally agree with the idea that mutual trust and openness play a crucial role in boosting cooperation.\nTo begin with, the best bosses understand the art of delegation. It strongly suggests that mutual trust is the premise of cooperation. With trust in each other, people of diverse temperaments, experiences, thinking modes and backgrounds can have a better understanding and communication, thus reducing unnecessary conflicts and frictions and promoting cooperation. Second, being open and inclusive reinforces the foundation for win-win cooperation. The Belt and Road Initiative could serve as a perfect example. The initiative welcomes countries along the routes to actively participate and invites friends from the rest of the world to join this great project with open arms, which will provide an inclusive platform for all the countries involved.\nIn sum, at no time should we underestimate the power of mutual trust and openness to promote cooperation. In conducting exchanges among colleagues or between countries, we need to be open and stick to the principle of mutual respect and trust to seize the opportunities for win-win cooperation.",

The main building consisting of two towers has become a popular attraction of the city because of its unique shape, attracting many tourists every day. The innovative structure of the building is attributed to the long-term collaboration between Chinese and foreign architects, which not only reflects environmental awareness, but also greatly saves building materials. CCTV Headquarters set up a dedicated passage through the building to show the public the various studios and the history of CCTV. From there, visitors can also enjoy the spectacular views of the Forbidden City and other places in Beijing.",
