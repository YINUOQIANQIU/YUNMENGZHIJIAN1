      "passage_content": "At 43, I've reached the stage where women are warned to brace for the sadness that will supposedly creep up at midlife. We're fed a steady stream of advice on \"how to survive your 40s\" as if we're on a slow limp toward ______. It's the age women start to become \"invisible\"—our value, attractiveness and power supposedly ______ by the vanishing of youth. But I don't feel like I'm fading into ______. I feel more seen than ever and have, for the first time in my life, a clear sense of myself: ______, compassionate and accepting. When I look in the mirror, I'm proud of who I am—even the bits I've spent a lifetime struggling to love. So when advertisers try to sell me their \"age-reversing\" remedies, I have to ______ a laugh. I wouldn't go back to my youth for all the money in the world. This hard-won self-acceptance is one of the joys of being an older woman. But the narrative is often ______ out by the shame marketers rely on to sell us diet pills, miracle creams and breathable yoga pants—as if self-love were a ______ commodity. For some women I know, this sense of trust and self-belief later in life gave them the courage to leave dysfunctional relationships or ______ on new career paths. Others talked about enjoying their own company, of growth through ______, deepening bonds of friendships, the ability to be more compassionate, less judgmental and to listen more and appreciate the small pleasures. Life past 40 is far from smooth sailing, but it's so much more than the reductive ______ we see in women's magazines and on the Hollywood big screen.",

      "passage_content": "A) Digital humans are coming to a screen near you. As computer-generated imagery (CGI) has become cheaper and more sophisticated, the film industry can now convincingly recreate people on screen—even actors who have been dead for decades. The technology's ability to effectively keep celebrities alive beyond the grave is raising questions about public legacies and image rights.\n\nB) Late in 2019, it was announced that US actor James Dean, who died in 1955, will star in a Vietnam War film scheduled for release later this year. In the film, which will be called Finding Jack, Dean will be recreated on screen with CGI based on old footage and photographs, with another actor voicing him. The news was met with excitement by those keen to see Dean digitally brought back to life for only his fourth film, but it also drew sharp criticism.\n\nC) The James Dean film is a way to keep the actor's image relevant for younger generations, says Mark Roesler of CMG Worldwide, the firm that represents Dean's estate. \"I think this is the beginning of an entire wave,\" says Travis Cloyd, CEO of Worldwide XR, one of the companies behind the digital recreation of Dean.\n\nD) Other actors have been revived, with the permission of their estates, for advertising purposes; for example, a 2011 advertisement for Dior featured contemporary actress Charlize Theron alongside iconic 20th-century stars Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Marlene Dietrich. Later, Audrey Hepburn was digitally recreated for a chocolate commercial in 2013.\n\nE) Now, a person can be animated from scratch. \"If they're alive today, you can put them in scanning rigs, you can get every detail of their body analysed very carefully and that makes it much easier, whereas working from available photographs is tricky,\" says Webber, who won an Academy Award for his visual effects work on the 2013 film Gravity. \"I also see a lot of actors today who will have the desire to take advantage of this technology: to have their likeness captured and stored for future content,\" says Cloyd.\n\nF) A hidden hazard of digitally recreating a deceased celebrity is the risk of damaging their legacy. \"We have to respect the security and the integrity of rights holders,\" says John Canning at Digital Domain, a US firm that created a hologram rapper Tupac Shakur, which appeared at the Coachella music festival in 2012, 15 years after his death.\n\nG) Legally, a person's rights to control the commercial use of their name and image beyond their death differ between and even within countries. In certain US states, for example, these rights are treated similarly to property rights, and are transferable to a person's heirs. In California, under the Celebrities Rights Act, the personality rights for a celebrity last for 70 years after their death.\n\nH) A recreation, however lifelike, will never be indistinguishable from a real actor, says Webber. \"When we are bringing someone back, representing someone who is no longer alive on the screen, what we are doing is extremely sophisticated digital make-up,\" he says. \"A performance is a lot more than a physical resemblance.\"\n\nI) As it becomes easier to digitally recreate celebrities and to entirely manufacture on-screen identities, could this kind of technology put actors out of jobs? \"I think actors are worried about this,\" says Edwards. \"But I think it will take a very long time.\" This is partly because of the risk that viewers find virtual humans scary.\n\nJ) This refers to the idea that when objects trying to resemble humans aren't quite perfect, they can make viewers feel uneasy because they fall somewhere between obviously non-human and fully human. \"That's always a danger when you're doing anything human or human-like,\" says Webber. \"There're a thousand things that could go wrong with a computer-generated facial performance, and any one of those could make it fall into the uncanny valley,\" he says.\n\nK) An unfamiliar digital human that has been created through CGI will also face the same challenge as an unknown actor; they don't have the appeal of an established name. \"You have to spend substantial capital in creating awareness around their likeness and making sure people are familiar with who they are,\" says Cloyd. This is now starting to happen.\n\nL) Webber expects that we will see more digital humans on screen. \"It's happening because it can happen,\" he says. Referring to a line from Jurassic Park, he adds: \"People are too busy thinking about what they can do to think about whether they should do it.\"",

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.",
      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nYou can't see it, smell it, or hear it, and people disagree on how precisely to define it, or where exactly it comes from. It isn't a school subject or an academic discipline, but it can be learned. It is a quality that is required of artists, but it is also present in the lives of scientists and entrepreneurs. All of us benefit from it and we thrive mentally and spiritually when we are able to wield it. It is a delicate thing, easily stamped out; in fact, it flourishes most fully when people are playful and childlike. Meanwhile, it works best in conjunction with deep knowledge and expertise.\n\nThis mysterious—but teachable—quality is creativity, the subject of a recently-published report by Durham Commission on Creativity and Education. The report concludes that creativity should not inhabit the school curriculum only as it relates to drama, music, art and other obviously creative subjects, but that creative thinking ought to run through all of school life, infusing the way humanities and natural sciences are learned.\n\nThe authors, who focus on education in England, offer a number of sensible recommendations, some of which are an attempt to alleviate the uninspiring and fact-based approach to education that has crept into policy in recent years. When children are regarded as vessels to be filled with facts, creativity does not prosper; nor does it when teachers' sole objective is coaching children towards exams. One suggestion from the commission is a network of teacher-led \"creativity collaboratives\", along the lines of existing maths hubs, with the aim of supporting teaching for creativity through the school curriculum.\n\nNevertheless, it is arts subjects through which creativity can most obviously be fostered. The value placed on them by the independent education sector is clear. One only has to look at the remarkable arts facilities at Britain's top private schools to comprehend this. But in the state sector the excessive focus on English, maths and science threatens to crush arts subjects; meanwhile, reduced school budgets mean diminishing extracurricular activities. There has been a 28.1% decline in students taking creative subjects at high schools since 2014, though happily, art and design have seen a recent increase.\n\nThis discrepancy between state and private education is a matter of social justice. It is simply wrong and unfair that most children have a fraction of the access to choirs, orchestras, art studios and drama that their more privileged peers enjoy. As lives are affected by any number of looming challenges—climate crisis, automation in the workplace—humans are going to need creative thinking more than ever. For all of our sakes, creativity in education, and for all, must become a priority.\n\nPassage Two\n\nEmulating your conversation partner's actions is a common human behavior classified as \"mirroring\" and has been known and studied by psychologists for years. We all tend to subconsciously copy gestures of people we like. But why do we act like this?\n\nAs a rule, mirroring means that conversationalists enjoy their communication and that there's a certain level of agreement between them. The topic of discussion is equally interesting for both and they know their interests meet.\n\nRepeating someone's behavior is typical of talented communicators, not always because the person is sympathetic, but because there is a goal to be achieved. This way new idols have been brought to the stage: politicians, celebrities, and other big names. Popular culture makes people want to look popular, and act and speak like popular people.\n\nNowadays celebrities steal lyrics from each other and struggle with copyright violation accusations or straightforwardly claim themselves to be the authors, even though all the work was done by other people.\n\nAmong celebrities, it's trendy nowadays to use their own speech writers as politicians do. The so-called \"ghostwriting\" can take various forms: books, articles, autobiographies, and even social media posts.\n\nWho is a true copycat and who gets copycatted? Sometimes, it is a hard nut to crack without an expert's help. But new authorship defending methods based on identifying individual writing patterns are already here. Their aim is to protect intellectual property. Using scientific methods, some of them can define authorship with 85% accuracy.\n\nWriting is not an easy craft to master. If you want to write like a professional without plagiarism, there are a few lessons to learn and the first one is: \"Copy from one, it's plagiarism; copy from two, it's research.\" The correct interpretation of this statement is not about copying, but rather about creating your own style. When you study an author's writing style, don't stop on a single one, but explore numerous styles instead. Examine types of sentences they use, pay attention to their metaphors, and focus on stories you feel you could write a pretty cool sequel to.\n\nImitation is rather paradoxical. As an integral part of learning, it brings about positive changes, making people develop and grow. However, it may do a lot of harm. Copying someone's thoughts, ideas or inventions is completely unacceptable. It infringes on intellectual property rights of others.\n\nStill, many things we do are about copying others one way or another. So if you want to compliment someone on the work they have done and imitate it, just make sure you do it the right way to avoid committing plagiarism.",
