      "passage_content": "A) Michael Wardian pushed forward into the penetrating arctic (北极的) wind, fighting the urge to speed up. Too much effort and he'd begin to sweat, which, he was told, would only increase the risk of hypothermia (体温过低).\n\nB) At the 2014 North Pole Marathon, the temperature dipped to minus-22 degrees F, with a wind chill that made it feel even colder. Along the route, armed guards wandered the large sheets of floating ice to minimize the risk of polar bear attacks.\n\nC) \"I like to do stuff that scares me,\" Wardian said. With ice frozen to his beard, Wardian crossed the finish line that April afternoon in a winning time of 4 hours 7 minutes and 40 seconds, almost two hours slower than his personal best over 26.2 miles. The race for Wardian, however, was less about the result than overcoming his aversion to the cold.\n\nD) In a few days, Wardian will once again compete in an unfamiliar territory and below-freezing temperatures. He will line up Monday in Antarctica (南极) for the first leg of the World Marathon Challenge—joining 32 other adventure seekers on an unusual journey where participants travel through different time zones and climates to run seven marathons on seven continents in seven days.\n\nE) An elite ultra-runner, Wardian has his sights on breaking the event's record average marathon time of 3:32:25set last January by U.S. Marine Corps captain Daniel Cartica. Wardian, a 42-year-old Arlington resident, is a record-breaking racer, known in the ultra running community for seeking tough courses and setting world records. Last year, he ran 1,254.65 miles in 47 races. The World Marathon Challenge, like most of Wardian's running goals, will be about pushing his limits. \"I love diverse and unique challenges,\" he said. \"I'm definitely interested in seeing what I can handle and what my body can accept. That drives me.\"\n\nF) Something about the way Richard Donovan carried himself appealed to Wardian. Perhaps it was the sense of adventure Donovan displayed when they first met at the 2010 50K Championships in Galway, Ireland, where Donovan was the race director. The two hit it off, and soon Wardian was participating in Donovan's events. It was at the North Pole Marathon, a race that Donovan organizes, that Wardian first heard about the Irishman's plan for the World Marathon Challenge—a challenge that Donovan himself completed in 2009 and 2012. \"I knew that many people had a goal of running seven marathons on seven continents during any time period,\" Donovan, 50, said. \"I felt the natural extension to this idea would be to try to achieve it within a seven-day period.\"\n\nG) Wardian started saving for the trip in 2014, connecting with sponsors and getting approval from his wife, Jennifer, before committing. Registration for the event costs 36,000 euros, which covers international charter flights to each of the seven marathon locations: Union Glacier (Antarctica), Punta Arenas, Chile (South America), Miami (North America), Madrid (Europe), Marrakesh, Morocco (Africa), Dubai (Asia) and Sydney (Australia). The challenge is a test of both physical strength and mental fitness. Sleeping on a crammed plane, adjusting to different time zones and finding food to eat (Wardian is a vegetarian) would make it an exhausting trip over a month, let alone a week. \"The key to a race like this is getting comfortable being uncomfortable,\" said Becca Pizzi, last year's women's champion. \"The highs of the race are incredibly high, and the lows incredibly low.\"\n\nH) Since turning it into an organized event in 2015, Donovan has attracted a variety of runners. This year's challenge will feature a far more elite field, which includes Ryan Hall, America's fastest marathon runner. Despite his proven track record, Hall said he has no time goals and that he still suffers from the same fatigue issues that forced him to leave the professional ranks in 2015. Hall plans to run with his friend, Pastor Matthew Barnett of The Dream Center in Los Angeles—one of the six American men who will be competing. \"I don't expect to run a step with Mike, but I will be excited to see how he does,\" said the 34-year-old Hall, who began weight-lifting after retiring. \"If I finish within an hour of him in each marathon, I'd be surprised.\"\n\nI) Instead, 43-year-old Petr Vabrousek, an elite Czech Ironman champion, is expected to be Wardian's closest challenger. To others on the trip, simply finishing will be its own reward. Sinead Kane of Ireland is aiming to become the first blind person to complete the challenge. And Beth Ann Telford, a 47-year-old federal government worker from Fairfax and the only American female in this year's mix, is using the event as a platform to raise money for cancer research. It's a cause with a personal connection to Telford, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2004. \"Doing something like this is definitely the hardest challenge that I've ever done except for the chemotherapy and brain surgery,\" she said. \"It's going to raise awareness... I just wanted to do something that is epic and this certainly is right up there.\" Wardian, too, hopes his involvement will give him a platform to promote a cause. He recently became an ambassador for the United Nations Women's HeForShe initiative to fight inequalities faced by women and girls worldwide.\n\nJ) On a chilly December afternoon, Wardian wove through Washington's crowded sidewalks on the way home from his full-time job as an international ship broker. His elastic, 6-foot frame bounced gently and efficiently off the ground with each step of the hilly six-mile trip back to Arlington. This is a daily routine during the week for Wardian, who started racing professionally in 2003 and runs seven days a week, often multiple times a day. When he travels, he prefers to explore new places on his feet.\n\nK) But in some ways, Wardian still has trouble thinking of himself as a runner. For the majority of his childhood, Wardian devoted his energy to becoming a Division I lacrosse (长曲棍球) player—a dream he realized when he was recruited to play at Michigan State University. \"Once he decides to do something, he just works at it until he does it,\" Michael's younger sister, Mariele, said. \"Once he decides to do it, it's usually something that's going to happen. He's always been like that. He's a very motivated individual.\"\n\nL) It was only a year or so ago that Wardian realized that he had been a runner longer than a lacrosse player. It was not until he ran in the 2004 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials—the first of three for Wardian—that he felt that he was a legitimate runner. Now more than 10 years and numerous ultra-marathon national titles and world records later, he embraces that identity. Wardian wants to see how far his legs can take him, one epic challenge at a time. \"I want to always keep doing things that are exciting, adventurous, different and most importantly, probably things I'm not the best at,\" Wardian said, \"because if you're not seeking things out that are challenging and difficult for you, then you're not growing... So I hope maybe people see what I do, and say, 'Okay, I want to do something different or try something new... I'm going to do something that scares me.' That's what I'm hoping people will take from it.\"",

      "passage_content": "Passage One\n\nMany people associate their self-worth with their work. The more successful their career, the better they feel about themselves. Work-related self-esteem is therefore a worthy ideal to pursue with vigor, right? Well, not always. According to recent research, in which psychologists interviewed 370 full-time workers over a period of three weeks, the reality is a little more complicated. And it involves negative as well as positive consequences.\n\nIt's natural to be drawn towards pleasure and to step away from pain. In the workplace, if that pleasure comes from a triumph which swells our self-respect, people will try to repeat the accomplishment. But repeating that accomplishment is often not realistic, which can lead to severe negative emotional consequences when it doesn't reoccur. This form of motivation is widely regarded as a negative type of motivation. It can hinder other more positive motivation types, such as completing a task purely because it's fulfilling or enjoyable.\n\nWhat consumes the employee instead is a pressing need to feel mighty and sure of themselves. They then take on only tasks and objectives which serve that ego-driven need. As a result, to avoid feelings of shame and worthlessness associated with failure, they extend themselves to such a degree that there's a subsequent adverse effect on their well-being. This internal pressure to succeed at all costs demands a lot of effort. It depletes their energy, culminating in disproportionate levels of damaging sentiment.\n\nThose negative emotions mount into heightened anxiety, impacting their ability to make the most of their personal life. Their desire to avoid feeling inferior ends up making them feel inferior when it comes to their diminished capacity for friendship and leisure. They end up dissatisfied both at work and outside of it.\n\nBut thankfully, for those people compelled almost entirely by this specific form of motivation, the news isn't all bad, or bad at all. The study also discovered several positive outcomes that can actually outweigh the harmful ones. Though these types of employees are motivated by the desire to avoid negative consequences, they are also motivated by the excitement of pursuing emotional rewards. This excitement makes pursuing goals enjoyable and stimulates pleasure and pride that would result from success. An effect of the positive motivation is that it neutralizes the existence of negative motivation.\n\nSure, it affects people's personal lives to what could be deemed an unhealthy extent, because leisure activities are often seen as a part of life that must be sacrificed to manage work and family demands. However, the way people feel about their work has less to do with whether they're motivated by the preservation of self-esteem but more with the fact that they're simply motivated.\n\nPassage Two\n\nDegradation of the world's natural resources by humans is rapidly outpacing the planet's ability to absorb the damage, a recent UN environmental study has found. The study concludes that without radical action the level of prosperity that millions of people in the developed world count on will be impossible to maintain or extend to poorer countries.\n\nWater scarcity is the curse of some of the poorest regions on Earth, leaving developing countries increasingly unable to feed themselves, and causing hardship for millions of people. There appears little prospect of this desperate situation being remedied without radical action being taken. Water resources are under increasing threat from population growth, climate change, rapid urbanization, rising levels of consumption, and the degradation of lands that previously provided a natural replenishment (补充) of water resources.\n\nThe rate of damage to the natural environment was found to increase globally, despite concerted efforts to persuade government to take measures to improve the condition. \"If current trends continue, and the world fails to improve patterns of production and consumption, then the state of the world's environment will continue to decline,\" warned UN executive director Achim Steiner.\n\nHe said the tools for improving the environment for millions of people existed in developed countries, but were in danger of not being used.\n\nThe study found that basic measures to tackle some of the key causes of environmental damage were still not being taken. These included measures to reduce air pollution; to control the damage to marine eco-systems, which can have a huge effect on fish stocks on which hundreds of millions of people depend; and to curb the degradation of land where modern agricultural methods were pursued without regard to the longer-term consequences.\n\nDespite the recent global agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, global carbon output continues to rise. This will put a long-term strain on the ability of developing economies to feed their own people. Climate change is aggravated by the emissions of greenhouse gases from chemical and natural fertilisers used in agriculture which increased by more than a quarter between 2000 and 2010. Other problem areas identified in the report included glaciers, which provide vital water resources for millions of people, but which are shrinking as the climate warms.\n\nIn rich countries, these problems have built up over decades and centuries while economic growth was pursued at the expense of the environment. Subsequent efforts to remedy the environment have met with partial success. But in developing countries, the path of future development has more potential to change, which has encouraged international institutions to devise more sustainable growth pathways that are supposed both to alleviate poverty and preserve the environment.",
