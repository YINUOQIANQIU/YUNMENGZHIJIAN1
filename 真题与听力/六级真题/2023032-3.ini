      "correct_answer": "People are now increasingly aware of the challenges in making a decision when faced with too many choices. We are presented with various options for almost every aspect of our lives, from what we eat to where we live. While having choices is often considered a good thing, having too many can be overwhelming and lead to low efficiency.\n\nFor example, when choosing a restaurant, we may spend an excessive amount of time scrolling through review apps and menus, trying to make the best decision possible. Even after we've made our choice, we may find ourselves questioning our decision and wondering if we should have chosen differently. This phenomenon is not just limited to ordinary choices like picking a restaurant. It can also occur with more significant decisions, such as choosing a career path or deciding where to invest our money.\n\nIn light of this, people are beginning to recognize the value of simplifying their decision-making process. Rather than focusing on the endless possibilities, they are looking for ways to narrow down their options and make more informed choices. One approach is to prioritize what matters most, whether it's quality, affordability or convenience.",

He led a huge fleet to sail seven times, visiting many countries and regions in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, enhancing mutual understanding between China and Southeast Asia and East Africa. Zheng He's expeditions to the Western Oceans played a very positive role in promoting economic and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries and also made great contributions to maintaining regional peace. In order to forever commemorate Zheng He's great achievements, July 11, the day when Zheng He first led a fleet on a distant voyage, has been designated as Maritime Day of China.",

      "correct_answer": "People are now increasingly aware of the digital gap or challenges the elderly face in a digital world. With the rapid growth of technology, the world has become more digitalized than ever before. However, not everyone has equal access to digital devices or the knowledge to use them effectively. Elderly people, in particular, are often left behind in adapting to a digital world.\n\nSuch digital gap is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. Many older adults are not familiar with modern digital technologies. They may find it difficult to use them due to various factors such as poor eyesight, hearing problems and cognitive decline. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge and skills in using digital devices can lead to isolation and loneliness.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it is essential to provide elderly people with access to technology and digital training. Many organizations have started to offer relative classes and even created specialized devices that are easier to use.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to recognize the challenges and provide necessary tools and training to help them become more comfortable with technology. By bridging the gap, we can help older adults to stay connected, engaged in a digital world.",

At the same time, he introduced the customs, geography, culture and unique species of the Western Regions to the Central Plains Region, greatly broadening people's horizons.\n\nAs historians point out, without Zhang Qian's expeditions to the Western Regions, the Silk Road would not have been created, and there would not have been cultural exchanges between the Han Dynasty and the western Regions or Europe.",
