          "suggested_version": "Nowadays parents are increasingly aware that allowing kids more freedom to explore and learn on their own helps foster their independence and boost their confidence. They finally figure out the fact that since kids are born to be curious about the world, granting them such freedom can help them develop an independent and confident personality, which is beneficial to their growth.\n\nFor one thing, allowing kids to learn and explore independently enables them to do things on their own. Kids have an instinct for exploring the world by themselves. In the process of exploration, children need to constantly imagine and try, which help develop an independent character. Once parents give them more freedom, they can do many things independently. For another thing, kids can gain self-confidence in the process of free exploration and learning. They may encounter failures and setbacks, but as long as they persevere and keep trying, they will achieve success and a sense of accomplishment, which will surely help boost their confidence to better face future challenges.\n\nTo conclude, parents allowing kids more freedom to explore and learn on their own can make them more independent and confident. It has beneficial effect on the growth of kids in the long run."

Their work offers new insights into the impact word choice has on how we _26_ between statements expressing what is real versus what is merely possible. The researchers assert their findings are important because we are presented with false information all the time. Some of this is _27_, as is the case with deceptive advertisements, but the problem is _28_ by individuals who believe they are sharing correct information. Thus, it is more important than ever to separate the factual from the possible or merely _29_ in how we communicate. This is especially true as the study makes clear that information presented as fact _30_ special responses in our brains, which are distinct from when we process the same content with clear indicators of _31_.\n\nIn their new study, the scientists intended to _32_ how the brain computes possibilities as expressed by words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" and \"if\". The researchers compared brain responses to statements expressing actual _33_ and those expressing possibility. \"There is a monster under my bed\" exemplifies a factual statement. \"I will stay home,\" is also factual. This is opposed to statements that express possibility, like \"There might be a monster under my bed,\" or \"If it rains, I will stay home.\" The results of the study showed that factual language _34_ a rapid increase in brain activity, with the brain responding more powerfully and showing more engagement with factual phrases compared to those communicating possibility. Thus, facts rule when it comes to the brain. Brain regions involved in processing _35_ rapidly distinguish facts from possibilities. Further, these regions respond in a much more robust fashion to factual statements.",

Archaeologists regard themselves as protectors of history, and they see salvors as careless destroyers. Salvors feel they do the hard work of searching for ships, only to have them stolen from under them when discovered. This kind of clash inevitably takes place on a grand scale. Aside from the salvors, their investors, and the maritime archaeologists who serve as expert witnesses, the battles sweep in local and international governments and organizations like UNESCO that work to protect under-water heritage. The court cases that ensue stretch on for years. Are finders keepers, or do the ships belong to the countries that made them and sent them sailing centuries ago? Where once salvors and archaeologists worked side by side, now they belong to opposing, and equally contemptuous, tribes."

Over the prior three years, he and his crew had obtained 14 state permits to survey a nearly 260-square-kilometer area off the cape; they worked 250 days a year, backed by investor funds of, he claims, US $4 million. It was hard work. Crew members were up at dawn, dragging sensors from their expedition vessels back and forth, day in and day out, year after year, to detect metal of any kind. Using computer technology, Pritchett and his crew created intricate, color-coded maps marked with the GPS coordinates of thousands of finds, all invisible under a meter of sand."

The discovery was cause for celebration. The artifacts indicated the divers had likely found the wreck of La Trinite, a 16th-century French vessel that had been at the center of a bloody battle between France and Spain that changed the fate of the United States of America."

Gathering data, unearthing and meticulously preserving and examining finds, verifying identity and origin, piecing together the larger story, and writing and publishing a comprehensive paper or book can take decades. A bit cynically, Bass describes colleagues who never published because they waited so long they became ill or died. Who is more at fault, Bass asks, the professional archaeologist who carefully excavates a site and never publishes on it or the treasure hunter who locates a submerged wreck, salvages part, conserves part, and publishes a book on the operation?"

That's exactly what singer and actress Selena Gomez has done in a bid to improve her mental health.\n\nShe has spoken extensively about the relationship between her social media usage and her mental wellbeing, recalling feeling like \"an addict\" when she became Instagram's most followed user in 2016. \"Taking a break from social media was the best decision that I've ever made for my mental health\", says she. \"The unnecessary hate and comparisons went away once I put my phone down.\"\n\nDitching the web at large, however, is a far more subtle and complicated prospect. The increasing digitisation of our society means that everything from paying a gas bill to plotting a route to a friend's house and even making a phone call is at the mercy of your internet connection. Actively opting out of using the internet becomes a matter of privilege.\n\nMs. Gomez's multi-millionaire status has allowed her to take the \"social\" out of social media, so she can continue to leverage her enormous fame while keeping the trolls (恶意挑衅的帖子) at bay. The fact that she's still the second most followed woman on Instagram suggests it's entirely possible to maintain a significant web profile to promote various projects—by way of a dedicated team—without being exposed to the cruel comments, hate mail and rape or death threats.\n\nIt goes without saying that this is fundamentally different from how the rest of us without beauty deals and films to publicise use the likes of Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, but even the concept of a digital detox (戒瘾) requires having a device and connectivity to choose to disconnect from.\n\nThe UK's digital divide has worsened over the past two years, leaving poorer families without broadband connections in their homes. Digital exclusion is a major threat to wider societal equality in the UK, so witnessing companies like Facebook championing the metaverse (元宇宙) as the next great frontier when school children are struggling to complete their homework feels particularly irritating.\n\nConsequently, it's worth bearing in mind that while deleting all social media accounts will undoubtedly make some feel infinitely better, many other people benefit from the strong sense of community that sharing platforms can breed.\nInternet access will continue to grow in importance as we edge further towards web 3.0, and greater resources and initiatives are needed to provide the underprivileged with the connectivity they desperately need to learn, work and live. It's crucial that people who feel that social media is having a detrimental effect on their mental health are allowed to switch off and for those living in digital exclusion to be able to switch on in the first place.",

                "content": "Psychologists have long been in disagreement as to whether competition is a learned or a genetic component of human behavior. Whatever it is, you cannot but recognize the effect competition is exerting in academics and many other areas of contemporary life.\nPsychologically speaking, competition has been seen as an inevitable consequence of human drives. According to Sigmund Freud, humans are born screaming for attention and full of organic drives for fulfillment in various areas. Initially, we compete for the attention of our parents. Thereafter, we are at the mercy of a battle between our base impulses for self-fulfillment and social and cultural norms which prohibit pure indulgence.\nCurrent work in anthropology (人类学) has suggested, however, that this view of the role of competition in human behavior may be incorrect. Thomas Hobbes, one of the great philosophers of the seventeenth century, is perhaps best remembered for his characterization of the \"natural world,\" that is, the world before the imposition of the will of humanity, as being \"nasty, brutish, and short.\" This image of the pre-rational world is still widely held, reinforced by Charles Darwin's highly influential work, The Origin of Species, which established the doctrine of natural selection. This doctrine, which takes for granted that those species best able to adapt to and master the natural environment in which they live will survive, has suggested that the struggle for survival is an inherent human trait which determines a person's success. Darwin's theory has even been summarized as \"survival of the fittest\"—a phrase Darwin himself never used—further highlighting competition's role in success. As it has often been pointed out, however, there is nothing in the concept of natural selection that suggests that competition is the most successful strategy for \"survival of the fittest.\" Darwin asserted in The Origin of Species that the struggles he was describing should be viewed as metaphors and could easily include dependence and cooperation.\nMany studies have been conducted to test the importance placed on competition as opposed to other values, such as cooperation—by various cultures, and generally conclude that Americans uniquely praise competition as natural, inevitable, and desirable. In 1937, the world-renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead published Cooperation and Competition among Primitive Peoples, based on her studies of several societies that did not prize competition, and, in fact, seemed at times to place a negative value on it. One such society was the Zuni Indians of Arizona, and they, Mead found, valued cooperation far more than competition. After studying dozens of such cultures, Mead's final conclusion was that competitiveness is a culturally created aspect of human behavior, and that its prevalence in a particular society is relative to how that society values it.",
