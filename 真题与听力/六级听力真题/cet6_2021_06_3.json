As computer-generated imagery (CGI) has become cheaper and more sophisticated, the film industry can now convincingly recreate people on screen—even actors who have been dead for decades. The technology’s ability to effectively keep celebrities alive beyond the grave is raising questions about public legacies and image rights."

In the film, which will be called Finding Jack, Dean will be recreated on screen with CGI based on old footage (影片镜头) and photographs, with another actor voicing him. The news was met with excitement by those keen to see Dean digitally brought back to life for only his fourth film, but it also drew sharp criticism. “This is puppeteering the dead for their fame alone,” actress Zelda Williams wrote on Twitter. “It sets such an awful precedent for the future of performance.” Her father, Robin Williams, who died in 2014, was keen to avoid the same fate. Before his death, he filed a deed protecting the use of his image until 2039, preventing others from recreating him using CGI to appear in a film, TV show or as a hologram (全息影像)."

Later, Audrey Hepburn was digitally recreated for a chocolate commercial in 2013. In the same year, a CGI Bruce Lee appeared in a Chinese-language ad for a whisky brand, which offended many fans because Lee was widely known not to drink alcohol at all. “In the last five years, it’s become more affordable and more achievable in a whole movie,” says Tim Webber at UK visual effects firm Framestore, the company behind the Hepburn chocolate ad. Framestore used body doubles with resemblance to Hepburn’s facial structure and body shape as a framework for manual animation. The process was extremely difficult and expensive, says Webber, but the technology has moved on."

In certain US states, for example, these rights are treated similarly to property rights, and are transferable to a person’s heirs. In California, under the Celebrities Rights Act, the personality rights for a celebrity last for 70 years after their death. “We’ve got a societal debate going on about access to our public commons, as it were, about famous faces,” says Lilian Edwards at Newcastle University, UK. Should the public be allowed to use or reproduce images of famous people, given how iconic they are? And what is in the best interest of a deceased person’s legacy may conflict with the desires of their family or the public, says Edwards."

Edwards cites widespread backlash to the digital recreation of Carrie Fisher as a young Princess Leia in Rogue One, a trick later repeated in the recent Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which was filmed after Fisher’s death in 2016. “People didn’t like it,” she says. “They discovered the uncanny valley (诡异谷).”"

            "content": "You can’t see it, smell it, or hear it, and people disagree on how precisely to define it, or where exactly it comes from. It isn’t a school subject or an academic discipline, but it can be learned. It is a quality that is required of artists, but it is also present in the lives of scientists and entrepreneurs. All of us benefit from it and we thrive mentally and spiritually when we are able to wield it. It is a delicate thing, easily stamped out; in fact, it flourishes most fully when people are playful and childlike. Meanwhile, it works best in conjunction with deep knowledge and expertise.\n\nThis mysterious—but teachable—quality is creativity, the subject of a recently-published report by Durham Commission on Creativity and Education. The report concludes that creativity should not inhabit the school curriculum only as it relates to drama, music, art and other obviously creative subjects, but that creative thinking ought to run through all of school life, infusing (充满) the way humanities and natural sciences are learned.\n\nThe authors, who focus on education in England, offer a number of sensible recommendations, some of which are an attempt to alleviate the uninspiring and fact-based approach to education that has crept into policy in recent years. When children are regarded as vessels to be filled with facts, creativity does not prosper; nor does it when teachers’ sole objective is coaching children towards exams. One suggestion from the commission is a network of teacher-led “creativity collaboratives”, along the lines of existing maths hubs (中心), with the aim of supporting teaching for creativity through the school curriculum.\n\nNevertheless, it is arts subjects through which creativity can most obviously be fostered. The value placed on them by the independent education sector is clear. One only has to look at the remarkable arts facilities at Britain’s top private schools to comprehend this. But in the state sector the excessive focus on English, maths and science threatens to crush arts subjects; meanwhile, reduced school budgets mean diminishing extracurricular activities. There has been a 28.1% decline in students taking creative subjects at high schools since 2014, though happily, art and design have seen a recent increase.\n\nThis discrepancy between state and private education is a matter of social justice. It is simply wrong and unfair that most children have a fraction of the access to choirs, orchestras, art studios and drama that their more privileged peers enjoy. As lives are affected by any number of looming challenges—climate crisis, automation in the workplace—humans are going to need creative thinking more than ever. For all of our sakes, creativity in education, and for all, must become a priority.",

            "content": "Emulating your conversation partner’s actions is a common human behavior classified as “mirroring” and has been known and studied by psychologists for years. We all tend to subconsciously copy gestures of people we like. But why do we act like this?\n\nAs a rule, mirroring means that conversationalists enjoy their communication and that there’s a certain level of agreement between them. The topic of discussion is equally interesting for both and they know their interests meet.\n\nRepeating someone’s behavior is typical of talented communicators, not always because the person is sympathetic, but because there is a goal to be achieved. This way new idols have been brought to the stage: politicians, celebrities, and other big names. Popular culture makes people want to look popular, and act and speak like popular people.\n\nNowadays celebrities steal lyrics from each other and struggle with copyright violation accusations or straightforwardly claim themselves to be the authors, even though all the work was done by other people.\n\nAmong celebrities, it’s trendy nowadays to use their own speech writers as politicians do. The so-called “ghostwriting” can take various forms: books, articles, autobiographies, and even social media posts.\n\nWho is a true copycat (抄袭者) and who gets copycatted? Sometimes, it is a hard nut to crack without an expert’s help. But new authorship defending methods based on identifying individual writing patterns are already here. Their aim is to protect intellectual property. Using scientific methods, some of them can define authorship with 85% accuracy.\n\nWriting is not an easy craft to master. If you want to write like a professional without plagiarism (抄袭), there are a few lessons to learn and the first one is: “Copy from one, it’s plagiarism; copy from two, it’s research.” The correct interpretation of this statement is not about copying, but rather about creating your own style. When you study an author’s writing style, don’t stop on a single one, but explore numerous styles instead. Examine types of sentences they use, pay attention to their metaphors, and focus on stories you feel you could write a pretty cool sequel (续篇) to.\n\nImitation is rather paradoxical. As an integral part of learning, it brings about positive changes, making people develop and grow. However, it may do a lot of harm. Copying someone’s thoughts, ideas or inventions is completely unacceptable. It infringes on intellectual property rights of others.\n\nStill, many things we do are about copying others one way or another. So if you want to compliment someone on the work they have done and imitate it, just make sure you do it the right way to avoid committing plagiarism.",
