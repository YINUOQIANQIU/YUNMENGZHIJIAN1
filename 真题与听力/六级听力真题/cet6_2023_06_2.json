            "passage": "Imagine sitting down to a big dinner: a massive steak, a large portion of fried potatoes, and cake for dessert. After eating so much, you should be too full to eat another bite. But some people experience a powerful urge to keep eating, even after 26 in a huge meal, a behavior that makes little sense, as most adults are well-versed in the dangers of obesity, which researchers have shown correlates with 27 health issues and is even linked to increased 28 risk. But some people still keep eating long after they should stop, a phenomenon Dr. Susan Thompson calls \"insatiable (永不滿足的) hunger.\" It is characterized by two main 29 : not being satisfied by eating, and having a desire to stay sedentary (久坐不动的). This is at 30 with how humans are biologically programmed. When there was a great deal of food available, ancient people would gorge on calories; this massive calorie intake was accompanied by an urge to get active. Humans were also programmed for something called \"compensation,\" which is the brain's 31 mechanism for preventing the accumulation of excess weight. With compensation, if you eat one large meal in the morning, you are naturally 32 to eat less for the rest of the day. But recent studies show that 70% of American adults have lost the ability to naturally compensate for the calories they consume; worse 33 , a significant number of them report 34 hunger halfway through an eating session, but, by the end of the meal, they feel the same or higher levels of hunger than when they sat down. Dr. Thompson argues that the main cause of this phenomenon is the modern diet, which is 35 of food high in sugar, carbohydrates and calories.",

Their schedules are meant to be literally punishing: If they are scientists in-training, they won't allow themselves to watch Netflix until their experiments start generating results. \"Relationships become estranged (疏远的)—people stop inviting them to social gatherings or dinner parties, which leads them to spend even more time in the lab,\" Pryor told me."

They measured three types of perfectionism: self-oriented, or a desire to be perfect; socially prescribed, or a desire to live up to others' expectations; and other-oriented, or holding others to unrealistic standards. From 1989 to 2016, they found, self-oriented perfectionism scores increased by 10 percent, socially prescribed scores rose by 33 percent, and other-oriented perfectionism increased by 16 percent."

These days, LinkedIn alerts us when our rival gets a new job, and Instagram can let us know how well \"liked\" our lives are compared with a friend's. In an opinion piece earlier this year, Curran and Hill argue that society has also become more dog-eat-dog. \"Over the last 50 years, public interest and civic responsibility have been progressively eroded,\" they write, \"replaced by a focus on self-interest and competition in a supposedly free and open marketplace.\" We strive for perfection, it seems, because we feel we must in order to get ahead. Michael Brustein, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan, says when he first began practicing in 2007, he was surprised by how prevalent perfectionism was among his clients, despite how little his graduate training had focused on the phenomenon. He sees perfectionism in, among others, clients who are entrepreneurs, artists, and tech employees. \"You're in New York because you're ambitious, you have this need to strive,\" he says. \"But then your whole identity gets wrapped into a goal.\""

In well-adjusted perfectionism, someone who doesn't get the gold is able to forget the setback and move on. In maladaptive (不当的) perfectionism, meanwhile, people make an archive of all their failures. They revisit these archives constantly, thinking, as Pryor puts it, \"I need to make myself feel terrible so I don't do this again.\" Then they double down, \"raising the expectation bar even higher, which increases the likelihood of defeat, which makes you self-critical, so you raise the bar higher, work even harder,\" she says. Next comes failure, shame, and pushing yourself even harder toward even higher and more impossible goals. Meeting them becomes an \"all or nothing\" premise. Pryor offered this example: \"Even if I'm an incredible attorney, if I don't make partner in the same pacing as one of my colleagues, clearly that means I'm a failure.\""

If the audience likes your work, that's because it's too stupid to know what good art actually is. But, therapists say, there are also different ways perfectionism manifests. Some perfectionists are always pushing themselves forward. But others actually fall behind on work, unable to complete assignments unless they are, well, perfect. Or they might handicap their performance ahead of time. They're the ones partying until 2 a. m. the night before the final, so that when the grade C rolls in, there's a ready excuse."

Yet despite all this, one group, which in no way has their best interests at heart, has almost unconstrained access. We seem to take it for granted that advertisers and marketers are allowed to condition even the youngest children. Before children have even developed a proper sense of their own identity, or learned to handle money, they're encouraged to associate status and self-worth with stuff, and to look to external things such as fame and wealth for validation. We're turning out little consumers rather than young citizens who will value themselves for what they contribute to the society in which they live. We've reached this point so gradually that many of us have never questioned it. It's crept up on us in the 60 years since advertisers started to target the young and found that they could recruit them to a commercial assault on their parents. We've come to know it as \"pester power\" or the ability of children to pressure parents to make certain purchases. Many psychologists, child development experts and educators point to research suggesting that this emerging cradle-to-grave consumerism is contributing to growing rates of low self-esteem, depression and other forms of mental illness. Not all psychologists agree. There're plenty working hand in glove with a £12bn-a-year industry that has turned the manipulation of adult emotions and desires into an art form—often literally. It's also one that's forever developing new ways to persuade our children to desire material possessions, and because of advertisements' viral effect they only need to infect a few to reach the many. Advertising and marketing can serve a useful, purpose for children. Marketing may help socialize children as consumers, inform them about products, and help them carve out unique identities as they reach adulthood. Then, should we ban all advertising aimed at young children? I say yes. Of course there'll be plenty of objections to an outright ban on advertising to the under-11s. There'll be those who argue that would be a breach of freedom of speech and infringe the rights of corporations to brainwash little children into demanding their products. Most parents hate what advertising does to their children, but we do have the power to end it and let our children grow up free from many of the pressures of consumerism until they're old enough to make their own decisions. And though advertising is only part of an all-pervasive (无处不在的) marketing culture we need to make a start somewhere. Let's ban all advertising targeting children of primary school age and younger now.",

                "content": "Many oppose workplace surveillance, because of the inherent dehumanizing effect it has and the relentless pressure it brings. But it's on the rise around the world as firms look to become more efficient by squeezing more productivity from their workers. More than half of companies with over $750m in annual revenue used \"non-traditional\" monitoring techniques on staff last year. Monitoring employee performance gives firms the ability to assess how their staff are performing and interacting, which can be good for both the firm and employees themselves. A growing number of analytics companies offer this service. They gather \"data exhaust\" left by employees' email and instant messaging apps, and use name badges equipped with radio-frequency identification devices and microphones. These can check how much time you spend talking, your volume and tone of voice, even if you do not dominate conversations. While this may sound intrusive, exponents argue that it can also protect employees against bullying and sexual harassment. Some of this data analysis can produce unexpected results. For example, it was found that people who sat at 12-person lunch tables tended to interact, share ideas more and outperform those who regularly sat at four-person tables, a fact that would probably have gone undetected without such data analysis. Over the last few years a Stockholm co-working space called Epicenter has gone much further and holds Popular \"chipping parties\", where people can have microchips implanted in their hands. They can use the implants to access electronically-controlled doors, or monitor how typing speed correlates with heart rate. Implanted chips may seem extreme, but it is a relatively small step from ID cards and biometrics to such devices. As long as such schemes are voluntary, there will probably be a growing number of convenience oriented uses so that a substantial number of workers would opt to have a chip inserted. But if implanted chips are used to reduce slack time or rest breaks, that could prove to be detrimental. And if surveillance tools take away autonomy, that's when they prove most unpopular. A lot depends on how such monitoring initiatives are communicated and this could prevent possible revolts being staged. If bosses don't communicate effectively, employees assume the worst. But if they're open about the information they're collecting and what they're doing with it, research suggests 46% of employees are generally okay with it. Although many such monitoring schemes use anonymized data and participation is voluntary, many staffers remain skeptical and fear an erosion of their civil liberties. So workplace surveillance could be empowering for staff and useful for companies looking to become more efficient and profitable. But implemented in the wrong way, it could also become an unpopular tool of oppression that proves counterproductive.",
